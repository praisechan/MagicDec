MYP and BBC are special contracting mechanisms that allow DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. The report provides background information and issues for Congress on the use of MYP and BBC, including their potential for reducing weapon procurement costs, the criteria for qualifying for MYP, and the differences between MYP and BBC.\n\nThe report notes that MYP can reduce the cost of the weapons being procured in two primary ways: contractor optimization of workforce and production facilities, and economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases of selected long-leadtime components. However, the report also notes that using MYP can reduce Congress's and DOD's flexibility for making changes in procurement programs in future years in response to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances.\n\nThe report also discusses the use of BBC, which is similar to MYP but does not have a permanent statute governing its use. The report notes that BBC has been used very rarely since its introduction in 1998, but it may be suitable as an alternative to MYP in cases where using a multiyear contract can reduce costs, but the program in question cannot meet all the statutory criteria needed to qualify for MYP.\n\nThe report concludes by noting that potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used, and whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC. The report also notes that the Coast Guard has never used MYP or BBC in its ship or aircraft acquisition programs, but it may be suitable for the Coast Guard to use MYP or BBC in the future.\n\nOverall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of the use of MYP and BBC by DOD and highlights the potential benefits and drawbacks of these contracting mechanisms. The report also identifies potential issues for Congress to consider in the future. \n\nKey points:\n\n* MYP and BBC are special contracting mechanisms that allow DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item.\n* MYP can reduce the cost of the weapons being procured in two primary ways: contractor optimization of workforce and production facilities, and economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases of selected long-leadtime components.\n* Using MYP can reduce Congress's and DOD's", "answers": ["Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8537}

However, the DOD faces significant sustainment challenges, including aging aircraft, maintenance and supply support issues, and high operating and support (O&S) costs. This report examines the trends in aircraft availability and O&S costs for 12 selected fixed-wing aircraft managed by the Air Force and Navy. The analysis found that half of the aircraft experienced decreasing availability, and the aircraft in general did not meet availability goals. The O&S costs for the selected aircraft varied, with some experiencing increases and others decreases. The Air Force and Navy have implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability, but DOD's policy and Navy guidance are unclear on whether legacy systems require a current sustainment strategy and whether the strategies need to be updated every 5 years. The report makes two recommendations to DOD: (1) update or issue new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, and (2) update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems. The report also highlights the need for DOD to have complete information on single sources of supply to proactively manage the risks associated with sustaining its weapon systems.\n\nKey findings:\n\n* Half of the selected aircraft experienced decreasing availability, and the aircraft in general did not meet availability goals.\n* O&S costs for the selected aircraft varied, with some experiencing increases and others decreases.\n* The Air Force and Navy have implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability.\n* DOD's policy and Navy guidance are unclear on whether legacy systems require a current sustainment strategy and whether the strategies need to be updated every 5 years.\n* The report makes two recommendations to DOD: (1) update or issue new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, and (2) update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n* The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment updates or issues new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems.\n* The Secretary of the Navy should update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems.\n\nThe report is a public version of a sensitive report that was issued on April 25, 2018.

The Air Force and Navy are operating many of their fixed-wing aircraft well beyond their original designed service lives and therefore are confronted with sustainment challenges. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to evaluate the sustainment of major weapon systems. This report, among other things, (1) examines the trends in availability and O&S costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft since fiscal year 2011, including whether they met availability goals, and (2) assesses the extent that the departments documented sustainment strategies, reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft by considering a variety of factors, such as the type, age, and manufacturer of the aircraft, among other factors, and analyzed condition and availability data, O&S costs, and sustainment challenges from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017 for each aircraft in a “Sustainment Quick Look.” GAO also analyzed policies, strategies, and plans, and interviewed Navy and Air Force officials in program offices, squadrons, and maintenance depots. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the Air Force and Navy generally did not meet aircraft availability goals, and operating and support (O&S) cost trends for GAO's selected fixed-wing aircraft varied. Specifically, GAO found that availability declined for 6 of 12 aircraft—3 from each service—between fiscal years 2011 and 2016; availability fell short of goals for 9 of 12 aircraft in fiscal year 2016; and O&S costs increased for 5 of the aircraft, and maintenance costs—the largest share—increased for 8 of 12 aircraft. GAO found, and officials agreed, that these aircraft face similar challenges. a Obsolescence means a part is unavailable due to its lack of usefulness or it is no longer current or available for production. b Diminishing manufacturing sources is a loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers. The Air Force and Navy have documented sustainment strategies for some aircraft, regularly reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented improvement plans. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for all aircraft GAO reviewed; however, the Navy has not documented or updated its sustainment strategies for four aircraft. Specifically, the Navy does not have a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A, and has not updated the strategies for the E2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D since before 2012. The Navy is in the process of documenting its strategies, but Department of Defense (DOD) policy is unclear on whether a sustainment strategy is required and has to be updated every 5 years for weapon systems that are in the operations and support phase of their life cycle (i.e., legacy systems). Also, Navy guidance does not specify a requirement for legacy systems, although Air Force guidance does. Clarifying the requirements to document sustainment strategies for legacy systems, and documenting those strategies, would add additional visibility over the availability and O&S costs of DOD aircraft and any associated sustainment risks. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in April 2018. Information on aircraft availability and other related information was deemed to be sensitive and has been omitted from this report.

However, the agencies have not prioritized the use of rewards and were unable to provide sufficient assurance that the rewards they paid from fiscal years 2007 through 2017 represented all of the rewards they provided during that period. FWS and NOAA have policies outlining the processes for making reward payments, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Both agencies have advertised the potential for rewards in specific cases, but have otherwise communicated little information to the public on the potential availability of rewards. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards or considered whether any changes might improve the usefulness of rewards as a law enforcement tool.

The Department of Commerce concurred with the three recommendations directed to NOAA, and the Department of the Interior concurred with the four recommendations directed to FWS. The report concludes that FWS and NOAA can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking activities by tracking reward information, augmenting their policies, and communicating more information to the public on rewards.

FWS and NOAA enforce laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking that authorize the agencies to pay financial rewards for information about such illegal activities. GAO was asked to review FWS's and NOAA's use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking. This report examines (1) laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which the agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) the agencies' reward policies, (3) information available to the public on rewards, and (4) the extent to which the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. GAO reviewed laws, examined FWS and NOAA policies and public communications on rewards, analyzed agency reward data for fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and assessed their reliability, interviewed FWS and NOAA officials, and compared agency policies and public communications on rewards to federal internal control standards. Multiple laws—such as the Endangered Species Act and Lacey Act—authorize the Departments of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. Specifically, the agencies collectively reported paying 27 rewards, totaling $205,500. Agency officials said that the information was complete to the best of their knowledge but could not sufficiently assure that this information represented all of their reward payments. FWS and NOAA have reward policies that outline the general process for preparing reward proposals, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Some FWS agents GAO interviewed said that in developing proposals, they did not know whether their proposed reward amounts were enough, too little, or too much. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare proposed reward amounts, consistent with federal internal control standards. FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on rewards. For example, most agency websites did not indicate that providing information on wildlife trafficking could qualify for a reward. This is inconsistent with federal standards that call for management to communicate quality information so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. FWS and NOAA officials said they have not communicated general reward information because of workload concerns, but they said it may be reasonable to provide more information in some instances. By developing plans to communicate more reward information to the public, the agencies can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking that they otherwise might not receive. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. The agencies have not done so because using rewards has generally not been a priority. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that such a review would be worthwhile but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that FWS and NOAA track reward information, FWS augment its reward policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS and NOAA develop plans to communicate more reward information to the public, and FWS and NOAA review the effectiveness of their reward use.

Data flows enable companies to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, and provide cross-border services. However, they also raise concerns around the security and privacy of the information being transmitted. The report highlights the need for policymakers to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce, including eliminating trade barriers and opening markets. The report also discusses the different approaches to data protection and privacy laws in various countries, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and China's Internet Sovereignty policies. The report notes that the United States has traditionally sought a balanced approach between trade, privacy, and security, but there is no single U.S. data privacy policy. The report concludes that finding a global consensus on how to balance open data flows and privacy protection is key to maintaining trust in the digital environment and advancing international trade. The report suggests that a system for global interoperability in a least trade-restrictive and nondiscriminatory way between different national systems could help minimize costs and allow entities in different jurisdictions with varying online privacy regimes to share data via cross-border data flows. The report also notes that the EU GDPR and China cybersecurity policies may become the global norms that other countries follow in the absence of a clear U.S. alternative. The report recommends that Congress consider enacting comprehensive privacy legislation and conducting oversight of the Administration's ongoing privacy efforts. Key recommendations include:\n\n* Balancing the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce\n* Eliminating trade barriers and opening markets\n* Developing a global consensus on how to balance open data flows and privacy protection\n* Creating a system for global interoperability in a least trade-restrictive and nondiscriminatory way between different national systems\n* Enacting comprehensive privacy legislation\n* Conducting oversight of the Administration's ongoing privacy efforts\n\nOverall, the report highlights the importance of finding a balance between the benefits of cross-border data flows and the need to protect consumer privacy and security.

Introduction\n\n* Importance", "answers": ["\"Cross-border data flows\" refers to the movement or transfer of information between computer servers across national borders. Such data flows enable people to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, provide cross-border services, and support technological innovation. Ensuring open cross-border data flows has been an objective of Congress in recent trade agreements and in broader U.S. international trade policy. The free flow of personal data, however, has raised security and privacy concerns. U.S. trade policy has traditionally sought to balance the need for cross-border data flows, which often include personal data, with online privacy and security. Some stakeholders, including some Members of Congress, believe that U.S. policy should better protect personal data privacy and security, and have introduced legislation to set a national policy. Other policymakers and analysts are concerned about increasing foreign barriers to U.S. digital trade, including data flows. Recent incidents of private information being shared or exposed have heightened public awareness of the risks posed to personal data stored online. Consumers' personal online data is valued by organizations for a variety of reasons, such as analyzing marketing information and easing the efficiency of transactions. Concerns are likely to grow as the amount of online data organizations collect and the level of global data flows expand. As Congress assesses policy options, it may further explore the link between cross-border data flows, online privacy, and trade policy; the trade implications of a comprehensive data privacy policy; and the U.S. role in establishing best practices and binding trade rules that seek to balance public policy priorities. There is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world, and there are no comprehensive binding multilateral rules specifically about cross-border data flows and privacy. Several international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G-20, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, have sought to develop best practice guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. U.S. and other recent trade agreements are establishing new enforceable trade rules and disciplines. Countries vary in their data policies and laws; some focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country's borders, aiming to protect domestic interests (e.g., constituents' privacy). However, these policies can also act as protectionist measures. The EU and China, two top U.S. trading partners, have established prescriptive rules on cross-border data flows and personal data from different perspectives. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is driven by privacy concerns; China is focused on security. Their policies affect U.S. firms seeking to do business in those regions, as well as in other markets that emulate the EU and Chinese approaches. Unlike the EU or China, the United States does not broadly restrict cross-border data flows and has traditionally regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce. The proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents the Trump Administration's first attempt to include negotiated trade rules and disciplines on privacy, cross-border data flows, and security in a trade agreement. While the United States and other countries work to define their respective national privacy strategies, many stakeholders seek a more global approach that would allow interoperability between differing national regimes to facilitate and remove discriminatory trade barriers to cross-border data flows; this could offer an opportunity for the United States to lead the global conversation. Although Congress has examined issues surrounding online privacy and has considered multiple bills, there is not yet consensus on a comprehensive U.S. online data privacy policy. Congress may weigh in as the Administration seeks to define U.S. policy on data privacy and engages in international negotiations on cross-border data flows."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7088}
{"pred": " The federal government plays a significant role in supporting the development of airport infrastructure through three main programs: the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC), and tax-exempt bonds. AIP provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. PFCs are a state, local, or port authority fee that airports can impose on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft, with the revenue used to finance eligible airport-related projects. Tax-exempt bonds are a major source of funding for capital projects at primary airports, allowing airports to raise funds more cheaply than would otherwise be the case.\n\nThe AIP program has undergone several changes since its creation in 1982, with the most recent reauthorization act funding the program at an annual level of $3.35 billion from FY2019 to FY2023. The program is divided into two main components: formula grants and discretionary funds. Formula grants are apportioned by formula to specific airports or types of airports, while discretionary funds are awarded directly to airports for projects in their airport master plans.\n\nThe federal government's interest in airport development goes beyond capacity issues to include implementation of federal safety and noise policies. The Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) has estimated that the national airport system's capital needs for FY2019-FY2023 will total $128.1 billion, while the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has estimated that the national system's capital needs for the same period will total $35.1 billion.\n\nThe report also discusses the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (AIPP), which allows airports to be exempt from certain federal restrictions on the use of airport revenue off-airport. The program has been expanded to include more than 10 airports, but only two airports have completed the privatization process established under the provisions of the AIPP.\n\nThe report concludes by highlighting the ongoing debate over FAA reauthorization, which often brings forth proposals to alter the AIP grant assurances, such as ensuring that workers on airport construction projects receive prevailing wages set under the Davis-Bacon Act. The report also notes that the permissible uses of revenues from PFCs are an ongoing point of contention, with airport operators seeking more freedom to use PFC funds for off-airport projects and carriers complaining that airports use PFC funds to finance proposals of dubious value. Overall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of the federal government's role in supporting airport development and the ongoing debates surrounding the A", "answers": ["There are five major sources of airport capital development funding: the federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP); local passenger facility charges (PFCs) imposed pursuant to federal law; tax-exempt bonds; state and local grants; and airport operating revenue from tenant lease and other revenue-generating activities such as landing fees. Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport's financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that \"is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes.\" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent? This report provides an overview of airport improvement financing, with emphasis on AIP and the related passenger facility charges. It also discusses some ongoing airport issues that are likely to be included in a future FAA reauthorization debate."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9366}
{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the military construction (MILCON) appropriations process used by the Department of Defense (DOD). The report highlights the process through which the active component requests funding for construction projects, the use of Form 1391 to support each project, and the flexibility of DOD to reprogram funds without congressional approval. The report also analyzes the active component's MILCON obligations and expended balances, finding that the component has a high obligation and expenditure rate associated with MILCON appropriations that have expired or been canceled. The report identifies three case studies of high-value MILCON projects, which showed that the cost estimates were not reliable and did not follow all the best practices for developing a reliable estimate. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and the Environment work with DOD's construction agents, military departments, and other offices to improve DOD's MILCON cost estimating guidance by fully incorporating all the steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates. The report also notes that the military departments have developed their own guidance for MILCON that more closely aligns with the 12 steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable estimates. Overall, the report highlights the importance of reliable cost estimates in the MILCON process and recommends improvements to ensure that DOD and congressional decision-makers have accurate information to inform their decisions. The report also provides detailed information on the active component's MILCON obligations and expended balances, as well as the analysis of the three case studies. The report concludes that the active component has a high obligation and expenditure rate associated with MILCON appropriations that have expired or been canceled, and that the cost estimates for the three case studies were not reliable. The report recommends that DOD improve its MILCON cost estimating guidance to ensure that cost estimates are reliable and accurate.

The report is available at no charge on the GAO website. The report was conducted from January 2016 to March 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The report provides a detailed analysis of the MILCON process and recommends improvements to ensure that cost estimates are reliable and accurate. The report is a valuable resource", "answers": ["Between fiscal years 2005 and 2016, Congress annually appropriated between $2.5 to $9.6 billion in MILCON funding for the active component of the U.S. military to use for projects worldwide. Reliable project construction cost estimates are of great importance, since those estimates drive these appropriations. House Report 114-537 accompanying a proposed bill authorizing national defense activities for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's MILCON cost estimating. This report examines the extent to which (1) the active component obligated and expended the MILCON appropriations received during fiscal years 2005-2016, (2) the active component reprogrammed MILCON appropriations during fiscal years 2010 through 2016, and (3) DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable for selected projects and DOD's guidance for developing estimates fully incorporates the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO analyzed the active components' MILCON execution data and reviewed DOD's guidance for cost estimating and compared it with the best practices identified in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . During fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in military construction funds (MILCON) to the active duty Army, Navy, and Air Force (referred to as the active component) for projects. As of September 30, 2016, the active component had obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of those funds. Of the $5.1 billion remaining unobligated, about $4.6 billion was still available to be obligated because MILCON appropriations are generally available for new obligations for 5 years. According to Department of Defense (DOD) officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either taken back by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. During fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million; the Navy, about $535 million; and the Air Force, about $295 million. DOD's guidance does not fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable estimates and the estimates for three projects that GAO reviewed were not reliable. Specifically, two of the three high-value projects GAO examined experienced a more than 30-percent increase from the initial cost estimates submitted to Congress. GAO determined that DOD cost estimators did not follow all the best practices associated with the four characteristics—comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—of a reliable estimate for these projects. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies 12 steps that, if used, are more likely to result in reliable and valid cost estimates. However, as shown below, DOD's construction guidance—the Unified Facilities Criteria—does not include all of these steps. Until DOD incorporates these steps, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. GAO recommends that DOD ensure that its cost estimating guidance fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable cost estimates. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendation and stated that it will issue revised cost guidance in fiscal year 2019 that more fully incorporates those steps that would benefit the military construction program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6142}
