And the evening and the\nmorning were the second day.\n\n1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together\nunto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n\n1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of\nthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding\nseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is\nin itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\n\n1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after\nhis kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n\n1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven\nto divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for\nseasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in\nthe firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was\nso.\n\n1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,\nand the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\n\n1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light\nupon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and\nto divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n\n1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving\ncreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the\nopen firmament of heaven.\n\n1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that\nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,\nand every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill\nthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n\n1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n\n1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after\nhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his\nkind: and it was so.\n\n1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle\nafter their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:\nand let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl\nof the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over\nevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\n1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created\nhe him; male and female created he them.\n\n1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion\nover the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every\nliving thing that moveth upon the earth.\n\n1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,\nwhich is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which\nis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n\n1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,\nand to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is\nlife, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n\n1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was\nvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\n\n2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of\nthem.\n\n2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and\nhe rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n\n2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that\nin it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\n\n2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when\nthey were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the\nheavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,\nand every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not\ncaused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the\nground.\n\n2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole\nface of the ground.\n\n2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living\nsoul.\n\n2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he\nput the man whom he had formed.\n\n2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is\npleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the\nmidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n\n2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence\nit was parted, and became into four heads.\n\n2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the\nwhole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that\nland is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n\n2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that\ncompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\n\n2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which\ngoeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\n\n2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of\nEden to dress it and to keep it.\n\n2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the\ngarden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge\nof good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou\neatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n\n2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be\nalone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n\n2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the\nfield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see\nwhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living\ncreature, that was the name thereof.\n\n2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,\nand to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an\nhelp meet for him.\n\n2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he\nslept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead\nthereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made\nhe a woman, and brought her unto the man.\n\n2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my\nflesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n\n2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall\ncleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n\n2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not\nashamed.\n\n3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which\nthe LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,\nYe shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said\nunto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\n3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,\nGod hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest\nye die.\n\n3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5\nFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall\nbe opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n\n3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that\nit was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one\nwise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto\nher husband with her; and he did eat.\n\n3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they\nwere naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves\naprons.\n\n3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in\nthe cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the\npresence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.\n\n3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art\nthou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was\nafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n\n3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten\nof the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\n3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she\ngave me of the tree, and I did eat.\n\n3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast\ndone? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n\n3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done\nthis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the\nfield; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the\ndays of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the\nwoman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,\nand thou shalt bruise his heel.\n\n3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and\nthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy\ndesire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n\n3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice\nof thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,\nsaying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;\nin sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns\nalso and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the\nherb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,\ntill thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\n\n3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother\nof all living.\n\n3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of\nskins, and clothed them.\n\n3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to\nknow good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also\nof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the\nLORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground\nfrom whence he was taken.\n\n3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden\nof Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep\nthe way of the tree of life.\n\n4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and\nsaid, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\n\n4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of\nsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n\n4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the\nfruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.\n\n4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of\nthe fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his\noffering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.\nAnd Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n\n4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy\ncountenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be\naccepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto\nthee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\n\n4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when\nthey were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,\nand slew him.\n\n4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he\nsaid, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What\nhast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from\nthe ground.\n\n4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her\nmouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou\ntillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her\nstrength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\n\n4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can\nbear.\n\n4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the\nearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and\na vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one\nthat findeth me shall slay me.\n\n4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,\nvengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark\nupon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n\n4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the\nland of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n\n4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he\nbuilded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his\nson, Enoch.\n\n4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and\nMehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n\n4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,\nand the name of the other Zillah.\n\n4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,\nand of such as have cattle.\n\n4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such\nas handle the harp and organ.\n\n4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every\nartificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n\n4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;\nye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to\nmy wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\n\n4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and\nsevenfold.\n\n4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his\nname Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead\nof Abel, whom Cain slew.\n\n4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his\nname Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.\n\n5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God\ncreated man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female\ncreated he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the\nday when they were created.\n\n5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his\nown likeness, and after his image;

and they took them wives of\nall which they chose.\n\n6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for\nthat he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty\nyears.\n\n6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,\nwhen the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare\nchildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of\nrenown.\n\n6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and\nthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\ncontinually.\n\n6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it\ngrieved him at his heart.\n\n6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the\nface of the earth;

and the waters\nincreased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.\n\n7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the\nearth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.\n\n7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the\nhigh hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.\n\n7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains\nwere covered.\n\n7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and\nof cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth\nupon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the\nbreath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.\n\n7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face\nof the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the\nfowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah\nonly remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\n\n7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty\ndays.\n\n8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the\ncattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over\nthe earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep\nand the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was\nrestrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth\ncontinually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the\nwaters were abated.\n\n8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of\nthe month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n\n8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the\ntenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the\nmountains seen.\n\n8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the\nwindow of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,\nwhich went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off\nthe earth.\n\n8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were\nabated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest\nfor the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for\nthe waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his\nhand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.\n\n8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the\ndove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;\nand, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that\nthe waters were abated from off the earth.\n\n8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;\nwhich returned not again unto him any more.\n\n8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the\nfirst month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from\noff the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,\nand, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\n\n8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the\nmonth, was the earth dried.\n\n8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,\nand thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n\n8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of\nall flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing\nthat creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the\nearth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.\n\n8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'\nwives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every\nfowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went\nforth out of the ark.\n\n8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean\nbeast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the\naltar.\n\n8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his\nheart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for\nthe imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I\nagain smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\n\n8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and\nheat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n\n9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be\nfruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n\n9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast\nof the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth\nupon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are\nthey delivered.\n\n9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the\ngreen herb have I given you all things.\n\n9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall\nye not eat.\n\n9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of\nevery beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of\nevery man's brother will I require the life of man.\n\n9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in\nthe image of God made he man.\n\n9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in\nthe earth, and multiply therein.\n\n9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And\nI, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after\nyou; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the\nfowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from\nall that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\n\n9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all\nflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall\nthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\n\n9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make\nbetween me and you and every living creature that is with you, for\nperpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall\nbe for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\n\n9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,\nthat the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my\ncovenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all\nflesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all\nflesh.\n\n9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that\nI may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living\ncreature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\n\n9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which\nI have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n\n9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and\nHam, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\n\n9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth\noverspread.\n\n9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\n9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered\nwithin his tent.\n\n9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,\nand told his two brethren without.\n\n9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their\nshoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their\nfather; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's\nnakedness.\n\n9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had\ndone unto him.\n\n9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be\nunto his brethren.\n\n9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be\nhis servant.\n\n9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of\nShem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n\n9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n\n9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and\nhe died.\n\n10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and\nJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\n\n10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and\nTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n\n10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n\n10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and\nDodanim.\n\n10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;\nevery one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n\n10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\n\n10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,\nand Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.\n\n10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n\n10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,\nEven as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\n\n10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and\nAccad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n\n10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the\ncity Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:\nthe same is a great city.\n\n10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and\nCaphtorim.\n\n10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the\nJebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,\nand the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the\nZemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the\nCanaanites spread abroad.\n\n10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest\nto Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and\nAdmah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.\n\n10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their\ntongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\n\n10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the\nbrother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.\n\n10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,\nand Aram.\n\n10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n\n10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.\n\n10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for\nin his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.\n\n10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and\nJerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and\nAbimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these\nwere the sons of Joktan.\n\n10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a\nmount of the east.\n\n10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their\ntongues, in their lands, after their nations.\n\n10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their\ngenerations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided\nin the earth after the flood.\n\n11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\n\n11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they\nfound a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\n\n11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn\nthem thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for\nmorter.\n\n11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose\ntop may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be\nscattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\n\n11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the\nchildren of men builded.\n\n11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all\none language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be\nrestrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n\n11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that\nthey may not understand one another's speech.\n\n11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of\nall the earth: and they left off to build the city.\n\n11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did\nthere confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the\nLORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\n\n11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years\nold, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem\nlived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n\n11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13\nAnd Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,\nand begat sons and daughters.\n\n11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah\nlived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n\n11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And\nEber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and\nbegat sons and daughters.\n\n11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg\nlived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n\n11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And\nReu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n\n11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug\nlived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n\n11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25\nAnd Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,\nand begat sons and daughters.\n\n11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and\nHaran.\n\n11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,\nNahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.\n\n11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his\nnativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\n\n11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife\nwas Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of\nHaran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.\n\n11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n\n11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's\nson, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they\nwent forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of\nCanaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.\n\n11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah\ndied in Haran.\n\n12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,\nand from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I\nwill shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I\nwill bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a\nblessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him\nthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be\nblessed.\n\n12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went\nwith him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed\nout of Haran.\n\n12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all\ntheir substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had\ngotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;\nand into the land of Canaan they came.\n\n12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto\nthe plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n\n12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I\ngive this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who\nappeared unto him.\n\n12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,\nand pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:\nand there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name\nof the LORD.\n\n12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\n\n12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into\nEgypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.\n\n12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,\nthat he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a\nfair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when\nthe Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:\nand they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n\n12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with\nme for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\n\n12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the\nEgyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\n\n12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before\nPharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.\n\n12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and\noxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,\nand camels.\n\n12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues\nbecause of Sarai Abram's wife.\n\n12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast\ndone unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19\nWhy saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to\nwife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\n\n12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him\naway, and his wife, and all that he had.\n\n13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he\nhad, and Lot with him, into the south.\n\n13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n\n13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto\nthe place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and\nHai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the\nfirst: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\n\n13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and\ntents.\n\n13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell\ntogether: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell\ntogether.\n\n13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and\nthe herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite\ndwelled then in the land.\n\n13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,\nbetween me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be\nbrethren.\n\n13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,\nfrom me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;\nor if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\n\n13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,\nthat it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom\nand Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,\nas thou comest unto Zoar.\n\n13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed\neast: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n\n13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the\ncities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\n\n13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD\nexceedingly.\n\n13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from\nhim, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art\nnorthward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all\nthe land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for\never.\n\n13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a\nman can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be\nnumbered.\n\n13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the\nbreadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.\n\n13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of\nMamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.\n\n14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,\nArioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of\nnations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with\nBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of\nZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\n\n14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is\nthe salt sea.\n\n14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year\nthey rebelled.\n\n14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that\nwere with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the\nZuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the\nHorites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n\n14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and\nsmote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that\ndwelt in Hazezontamar.\n\n14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,\nand the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela\n(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of\nSiddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king\nof nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;\nfour kings with five.\n\n14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of\nSodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled\nto the mountain.\n\n14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their\nvictuals, and went their way.\n\n14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,\nand his goods, and departed.\n\n14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;\nfor he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and\nbrother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.\n\n14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he\narmed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and\neighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.\n\n14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by\nnight, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the\nleft hand of Damascus.\n\n14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his\nbrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\n\n14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from\nthe slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at\nthe valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.\n\n14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and\nhe was the priest of the most high God.\n\n14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high\nGod, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most high\nGod, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him\ntithes of all.\n\n14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and\ntake the goods to thyself.\n\n14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand\nunto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,\n14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and\nthat I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,\nI have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men have\neaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,\nand Mamre; let them take their portion.\n\n15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a\nvision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding\ngreat reward.\n\n15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go\nchildless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?\n15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,\none born in my house is mine heir.\n\n15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This\nshall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own\nbowels shall be thine heir.\n\n15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward\nheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he\nsaid unto him, So shall thy seed be.\n\n15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for\nrighteousness.\n\n15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur\nof the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n\n15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit\nit?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,\nand a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a\nturtledove, and a young pigeon.\n\n15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,\nand laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\n\n15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them\naway.\n\n15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;\nand, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n\n15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be\na stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and\nthey shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that\nnation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they\ncome out with great substance.\n\n15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried\nin a good old age.\n\n15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for\nthe iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\n\n15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was\ndark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between\nthose pieces.\n\n15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,\nUnto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the\ngreat river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the\nKenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the\nPerizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the\nCanaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\n\n16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an\nhandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n\n16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained\nme from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may\nobtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n\n16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after\nAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her\nhusband Abram to be his wife.\n\n16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw\nthat she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n\n16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my\nmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was\ndespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.\n\n16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do\nto her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she\nfled from her face.\n\n16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the\nwilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n\n16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither\nwilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n\n16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,\nand submit thyself under her hands.\n\n16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy\nseed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n\n16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with\nchild and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because\nthe LORD hath heard thy affliction.\n\n16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,\nand every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence\nof all his brethren.\n\n16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou\nGod seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that\nseeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,\nit is between Kadesh and Bered.\n\n16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,\nwhich Hagar bare, Ishmael.\n\n16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare\nIshmael to Abram.\n\n17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared\nto Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,\nand be thou perfect.\n\n17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will\nmultiply thee exceedingly.\n\n17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4\nAs for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a\nfather of many nations.\n\n17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name\nshall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.\n\n17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations\nof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\n\n17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed\nafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a\nGod unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\n\n17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land\nwherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an\neverlasting possession; and I will be their God.\n\n17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,\nthou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.\n\n17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and\nthy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.\n\n17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall\nbe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.\n\n17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,\nevery man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or\nbought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.\n\n17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy\nmoney, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your\nflesh for an everlasting covenant.\n\n17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is\nnot circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath\nbroken my covenant.\n\n17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not\ncall her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n\n17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I\nwill bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people\nshall be of her.\n\n17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his\nheart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?\nand shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham\nsaid unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And God\nsaid, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call\nhis name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an\neverlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.\n\n17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed\nhim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;\ntwelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\n\n17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall\nbear unto thee at this set time in the next year.\n\n17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n\n17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his\nhouse, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the\nmen of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in\nthe selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\n\n17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n\n17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n\n17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his\nson.\n\n17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with\nmoney of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\n\n18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat\nin the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes\nand looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he\nran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the\nground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy\nsight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little\nwater, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves\nunder the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort\nye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come\nto your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n\n18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make\nready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes\nupon the hearth.\n\n18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,\nand gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n\n18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,\nand set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they\ndid eat.\n\n18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,\nBehold, in the tent.\n\n18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the\ntime of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah\nheard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n\n18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it\nceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n\n18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed\nold shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD\nsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a\nsurety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard for\nthe LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to\nthe time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n\n18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.\nAnd he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n\n18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and\nAbraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n\n18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I\ndo; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty\nnation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his\nhousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do\njustice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which\nhe hath spoken of him.\n\n18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is\ngreat, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down\nnow, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of\nit, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\n\n18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward\nSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n\n18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the\nrighteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fifty\nrighteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the\nplace for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be far\nfrom thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the\nwicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far\nfrom thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 And\nthe LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,\nthen I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n\n18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me\nto speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28\nPeradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou\ndestroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there\nforty and five, I will not destroy it.\n\n18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there\nshall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's\nsake.\n\n18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will\nspeak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I\nwill not do it, if I find thirty there.\n\n18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the\nLORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I\nwill not destroy it for twenty's sake.\n\n18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet\nbut this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I\nwill not destroy it for ten's sake.\n\n18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with\nAbraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n\n19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the\ngate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed\nhimself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,\nmy lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry\nall night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on\nyour ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all\nnight.\n\n19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,\nand entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake\nunleavened bread, and they did eat.\n\n19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of\nSodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people\nfrom every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,\nWhere are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out\nunto us, that we may know them.\n\n19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after\nhim, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n\n19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let\nme, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good\nin your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they\nunder the shadow of my roof.\n\n19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow\ncame in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal\nworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,\neven Lot, and came near to break the door.\n\n19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house\nto them, and shut to the door.\n\n19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with\nblindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to\nfind the door.\n\n19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in\nlaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the\ncity, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy this\nplace, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the\nLORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.\n\n19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married\nhis daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD\nwill destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons\nin law.\n\n19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,\nsaying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;\nlest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n\n19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon\nthe hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD\nbeing merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him\nwithout the city.\n\n19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,\nthat he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay\nthou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\n\n19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,\nthy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy\nmercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot\nescape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20\nBehold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:\nOh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall\nlive.\n\n19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this\nthing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou\nhast spoken.\n\n19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou\nbe come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n\n19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n\n19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and\nfire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,\nand all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that\nwhich grew upon the ground.\n\n19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\npillar of salt.\n\n19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he\nstood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,\nand toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke\nof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n\n19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,\nthat God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the\noverthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\n\n19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his\ntwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt\nin a cave, he and his two daughters.\n\n19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and\nthere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of\nall the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we\nwill lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n\n19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the\nfirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when\nshe lay down, nor when she arose.\n\n19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto\nthe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him\ndrink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we\nmay preserve seed of our father.\n\n19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the\nyounger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay\ndown, nor when she arose.\n\n19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n\n19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the\nsame is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\n\n19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name\nBenammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this\nday.\n\n20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and\ndwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n\n20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and\nAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n\n20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,\nBehold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;\nfor she is a man's wife.\n\n20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou\nslay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my\nsister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the\nintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n\n20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst\nthis in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from\nsinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n\n20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and\nhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her\nnot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are\nthine.\n\n20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his\nservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were\nsore afraid.\n\n20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou\ndone unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on\nme and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that\nought not to be done.\n\n20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou\nhast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,\nSurely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for\nmy wife's sake.\n\n20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my\nfather, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n\n20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my\nfather's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou\nshalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,\nHe is my brother.\n\n20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\nwomenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his\nwife.\n\n20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where\nit pleaseth thee.\n\n20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a\nthousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the\neyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was\nreproved.\n\n20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his\nwife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\n\n20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of\nAbimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n\n21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto\nSarah as he had spoken.\n\n21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at\nthe set time of which God had spoken to him.\n\n21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,\nwhom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n\n21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as\nGod had commanded him.\n\n21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born\nunto him.\n\n21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear\nwill laugh with me.\n\n21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should\nhave given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.\n\n21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great\nfeast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n\n21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born\nunto Abraham, mocking.\n\n21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her\nson: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even\nwith Isaac.\n\n21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of\nhis son.\n\n21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight\nbecause of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah\nhath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy\nseed be called.\n\n21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,\nbecause he is thy seed.\n\n21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a\nbottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,\nand the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in\nthe wilderness of Beersheba.\n\n21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child\nunder one of the shrubs.\n\n21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,\nas it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the\nchild. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.\n\n21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called\nto Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?\nfear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.\n\n21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will\nmake him a great nation.\n\n21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she\nwent, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n\n21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the\nwilderness, and became an archer.\n\n21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him\na wife out of the land of Egypt.\n\n21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the\nchief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee\nin all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God\nthat thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my\nson's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,\nthou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n\n21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n\n21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which\nAbimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n\n21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither\ndidst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.\n\n21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;\nand both of them made a covenant.\n\n21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n\n21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs\nwhich thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these seven\newe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto\nme, that I have digged this well.\n\n21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they\nsware both of them.\n\n21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,\nand Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the\nland of the Philistines.\n\n21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on\nthe name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n\n21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n\n22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\nAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\n\n22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou\nlovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for\na burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\n\n22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,\nand took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave\nthe wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place\nof which God had told him.\n\n22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the\nplace afar off.\n\n22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;\nand I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\n\n22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon\nIsaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they\nwent both of them together.\n\n22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and\nhe said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:\nbut where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, My\nson, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they\nwent both of them together.\n\n22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham\nbuilt an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his\nson, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n\n22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay\nhis son.\n\n22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and\nsaid, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n\n22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou\nany thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou\nhast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\n\n22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind\nhim a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took\nthe ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his\nson.\n\n22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is\nsaid to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.\n\n22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the\nsecond time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,\nfor because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,\nthine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in\nmultiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and\nas the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess\nthe gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations\nof the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n\n22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and\nwent together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.\n\n22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told\nAbraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy\nbrother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and\nKemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,\nand Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n\n22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,\nAbraham's brother.\n\n22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,\nand Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n\n23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these\nwere the years of the life of Sarah.\n\n23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of\nCanaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n\n23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the\nsons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:\ngive me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my\ndead out of my sight.\n\n23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6\nHear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of\nour sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his\nsepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\n\n23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the\nland, even to the children of Heth.\n\n23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I\nshould bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to\nEphron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of\nMachpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as\nmuch money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a\nburyingplace amongst you.\n\n23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the\nHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even\nof all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my\nlord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I\ngive it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:\nbury thy dead.\n\n23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\n\n23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the\nland, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will\ngive thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead\nthere.\n\n23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,\nhearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;\nwhat is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n\n23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron\nthe silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,\nfour hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\n\n23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before\nMamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees\nthat were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were\nmade sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the\nchildren of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\n\n23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the\nfield of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of\nCanaan.\n\n23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto\nAbraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.\n\n24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had\nblessed Abraham in all things.\n\n24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled\nover all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3\nAnd I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God\nof the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the\ndaughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt\ngo unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son\nIsaac.\n\n24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be\nwilling to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again\nunto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto\nhim, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\n\n24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and\nfrom the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware\nunto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send\nhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from\nthence.\n\n24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou\nshalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n\n24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his\nmaster, and sware to him concerning that matter.\n\n24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and\ndeparted; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he\narose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\n\n24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well\nof water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out\nto draw water.\n\n24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send\nme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.\n\n24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of\nthe men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to\npass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I\npray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give\nthy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed\nfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed\nkindness unto my master.\n\n24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,\nRebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of\nNahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n\n24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had\nany man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her\npitcher, and came up.\n\n24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,\ndrink a little water of thy pitcher.\n\n24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her\npitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\n\n24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw\nwater for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\n\n24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran\nagain unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\n\n24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the\nLORD had made his journey prosperous or not.\n\n24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the\nman took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets\nfor her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose\ndaughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's\nhouse for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the\ndaughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.\n\n24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender\nenough, and room to lodge in.\n\n24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\n\n24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who\nhath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being\nin the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.\n\n24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these\nthings.\n\n24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran\nout unto the man, unto the well.\n\n24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon\nhis sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,\nsaying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,\nbehold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n\n24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore\nstandest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the\ncamels.\n\n24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and\ngave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,\nand the men's feet that were with him.\n\n24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will\nnot eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n\n24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\n\n24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become\ngreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,\nand menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\n\n24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was\nold: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.\n\n24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife\nto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and\ntake a wife unto my son.\n\n24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not\nfollow me.\n\n24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his\nangel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for\nmy son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thou\nbe clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if\nthey give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n\n24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my\nmaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43\nBehold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that\nwhen the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,\nI pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say\nto me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the\nsame be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's\nson.\n\n24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah\ncame forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto\nthe well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray\nthee.\n\n24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,\nand said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,\nand she made the camels drink also.\n\n24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she\nsaid, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:\nand I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n\n24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed\nthe LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way\nto take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.\n\n24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell\nme: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the\nleft.\n\n24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth\nfrom the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\n\n24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be\nthy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.\n\n24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their\nwords, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\n\n24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of\ngold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her\nbrother and to her mother precious things.\n\n24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,\nand tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,\nSend me away unto my master.\n\n24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with\nus a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n\n24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath\nprospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n\n24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her\nmouth.\n\n24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with\nthis man? And she said, I will go.\n\n24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and\nAbraham's servant, and his men.\n\n24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our\nsister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed\npossess the gate of those which hate them.\n\n24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the\ncamels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went\nhis way.\n\n24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt\nin the south country.\n\n24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and\nhe lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.\n\n24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she\nlighted off the camel.\n\n24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh\nin the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:\ntherefore she took a vail, and covered herself.\n\n24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n\n24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took\nRebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was\ncomforted after his mother's death.\n\n25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\n\n25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and\nIshbak, and Shuah.\n\n25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were\nAsshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n\n25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,\nand Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n\n25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n\n25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham\ngave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,\neastward, unto the east country.\n\n25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he\nlived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\n\n25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an\nold man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\n\n25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of\nMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which\nis before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons\nof Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n\n25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed\nhis son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.\n\n25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom\nHagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And\nthese are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according\nto their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,\nand Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15\nHadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons\nof Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their\ncastles; twelve princes according to their nations.\n\n25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and\nthirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was\ngathered unto his people.\n\n25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as\nthou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his\nbrethren.\n\n25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham\nbegat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah\nto wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister\nto Laban the Syrian.\n\n25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was\nbarren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife\nconceived.\n\n25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If\nit be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.\n\n25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two\nmanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one\npeople shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall\nserve the younger.\n\n25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there\nwere twins in her womb.\n\n25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and\nthey called his name Esau.\n\n25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on\nEsau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore\nyears old when she bare them.\n\n25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the\nfield; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n\n25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but\nRebekah loved Jacob.\n\n25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was\nfaint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that\nsame red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n\n25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\n\n25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit\nshall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me\nthis day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto\nJacob.\n\n25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did\neat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his\nbirthright.\n\n26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that\nwas in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the\nPhilistines unto Gerar.\n\n26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;\ndwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this\nland, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and\nunto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the\noath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thy\nseed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed\nall these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the\nearth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept\nmy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n\n26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him\nof his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She\nis my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for\nRebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\n\n26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that\nAbimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,\nand, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n\n26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is\nthy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto\nhim, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n\n26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of\nthe people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest\nhave brought guiltiness upon us.\n\n26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth\nthis man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n\n26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an\nhundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.\n\n26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he\nbecame very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and\npossession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines\nenvied him.\n\n26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the\ndays of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and\nfilled them with earth.\n\n26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much\nmightier than we.\n\n26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of\nGerar, and dwelt there.\n\n26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged\nin the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped\nthem after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the\nnames by which his father had called them.\n\n26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a\nwell of springing water.\n\n26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,\nsaying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;\nbecause they strove with him.\n\n26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he\ncalled the name of it Sitnah.\n\n26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for\nthat they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he\nsaid, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful\nin the land.\n\n26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.\n\n26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am\nthe God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.\n\n26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the\nLORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a\nwell.\n\n26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his\nfriends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n\n26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye\nhate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw\ncertainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now\nan oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a\ncovenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not\ntouched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have\nsent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\n\n26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n\n26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to\nanother: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in\npeace.\n\n26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,\nand told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto\nhim, We have found water.\n\n26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is\nBeersheba unto this day.\n\n26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the\ndaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the\nHittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n\n27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were\ndim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said\nunto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.\n\n27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my\ndeath: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver\nand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4\nAnd make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I\nmay eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n\n27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went\nto the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n\n27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy\nfather speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and\nmake me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD\nbefore my death.\n\n27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I\ncommand thee.\n\n27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of\nthe goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as\nhe loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may\neat, and that he may bless thee before his death.\n\n27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is\na hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will\nfeel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a\ncurse upon me, and not a blessing.\n\n27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only\nobey my voice, and go fetch me them.\n\n27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and\nhis mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n\n27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which\nwere with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:\n27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,\nand upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat\nand the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n\n27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,\nHere am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his\nfather, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest\nme: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may\nbless me.\n\n27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it\nso quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it\nto me.\n\n27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may\nfeel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n\n27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and\nsaid, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n\n27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his\nbrother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.\n\n27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n\n27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's\nvenison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,\nand he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.\n\n27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,\nmy son.\n\n27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of\nhis raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as\nthe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore God\ngive thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and\nplenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow\ndown to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow\ndown to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he\nthat blesseth thee.\n\n27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of\nblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of\nIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n\n27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his\nfather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his\nson's venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n\n27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I\nam thy son, thy firstborn Esau.\n\n27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he\nthat hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all\nbefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be\nblessed.\n\n27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a\ngreat and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,\neven me also, O my father.\n\n27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away\nthy blessing.\n\n27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath\nsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,\nbehold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not\nreserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto\nEsau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I\ngiven to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained\nhim: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said\nunto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even\nme also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n\n27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy\ndwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven\nfrom above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve\nthy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the\ndominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n\n27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his\nfather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning\nfor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n\n27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and\nshe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,\nthy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to\nkill thee.\n\n27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban\nmy brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy\nbrother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn away\nfrom thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will\nsend, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you\nboth in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my\nlife because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the\ndaughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the\nland, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and\nblessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a\nwife of the daughters of Canaan.\n\n28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's\nfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy\nmother's brother.\n\n28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply\nthee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee\nthe blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou\nmayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave\nunto Abraham.\n\n28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,\nson of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's\nmother.\n\n28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to\nPadanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him\nhe gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the\ndaughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his\nmother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the\ndaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esau\nunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the\ndaughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his\nwife.\n\n28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n\n28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all\nnight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that\nplace, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to\nsleep.\n\n28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the\ntop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending\nand descending on it.\n\n28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD\nGod of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou\nliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed\nshall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the\nwest, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee\nand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n\n28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places\nwhither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I\nwill not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to\nthee of.\n\n28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD\nis in this place; and I knew it not.\n\n28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is\nnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n\n28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that\nhe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil\nupon the top of it.\n\n28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of\nthat city was called Luz at the first.\n\n28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will\nkeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and\nraiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in\npeace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which I\nhave set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou\nshalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\n\n29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the\npeople of the east.\n\n29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there\nwere three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they\nwatered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.\n\n29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the\nstone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone\nagain upon the well's mouth in his place.\n\n29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they\nsaid, Of Haran are we.\n\n29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they\nsaid, We know him.\n\n29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:\nand, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n\n29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the\ncattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and\nfeed them.\n\n29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered\ntogether, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we\nwater the sheep.\n\n29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's\nsheep; for she kept them.\n\n29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban\nhis mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,\nthat Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and\nwatered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.\n\n29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n\n29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that\nhe was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n\n29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his\nsister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed\nhim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n\n29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And\nhe abode with him the space of a month.\n\n29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,\nshouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy\nwages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder\nwas Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n\n29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well\nfavoured.\n\n29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years\nfor Rachel thy younger daughter.\n\n29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that\nI should give her to another man: abide with me.\n\n29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto\nhim but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n\n29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are\nfulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n\n29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a\nfeast.\n\n29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his\ndaughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n\n29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an\nhandmaid.\n\n29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:\nand he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I\nserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give\nthe younger before the firstborn.\n\n29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service\nwhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n\n29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel\nhis daughter to wife also.\n\n29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be\nher maid.\n\n29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more\nthan Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n\n29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:\nbut Rachel was barren.\n\n29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name\nReuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;\nnow therefore my husband will love me.\n\n29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the\nLORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:\nand she called his name Simeon.\n\n29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time\nwill my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:\ntherefore was his name called Levi.\n\n29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will\nI praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left\nbearing.\n\n30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel\nenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I\ndie.\n\n30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I\nin God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she\nshall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.\n\n30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in\nunto her.\n\n30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n\n30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my\nvoice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\n\n30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second\nson.\n\n30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my\nsister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n\n30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her\nmaid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n\n30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.\n\n30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\n\n30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.\n\n30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me\nblessed: and she called his name Asher.\n\n30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found\nmandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then\nRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.\n\n30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken\nmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And\nRachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's\nmandrakes.\n\n30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went\nout to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I\nhave hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that\nnight.\n\n30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob\nthe fifth son.\n\n30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given\nmy maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n\n30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n\n30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my\nhusband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she\ncalled his name Zebulun.\n\n30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n\n30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened\nher womb.\n\n30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away\nmy reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD\nshall add to me another son.\n\n30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob\nsaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and\nto my country.\n\n30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,\nand let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\n\n30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in\nthine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath\nblessed me for thy sake.\n\n30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n\n30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and\nhow thy cattle was with me.\n\n30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now\nincreased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my\ncoming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31\nAnd he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not\ngive me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again\nfeed and keep thy flock.\n\n30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence\nall the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among\nthe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such\nshall be my hire.\n\n30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it\nshall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled\nand spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be\ncounted stolen with me.\n\n30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy\nword.\n\n30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and\nspotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and\nevery one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the\nsheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n\n30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and\nJacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n\n30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and\nchesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white\nappear which was in the rods.\n\n30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the\ngutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that\nthey should conceive when they came to drink.\n\n30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\ncattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n\n30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the\nflocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of\nLaban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto\nLaban's cattle.\n\n30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did\nconceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in\nthe gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n\n30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the\nfeebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n\n30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and\nmaidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n\n31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken\naway all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's\nhath he gotten all this glory.\n\n31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was\nnot toward him as before.\n\n31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy\nfathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n\n31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his\nflock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that\nit is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with\nme.\n\n31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n\n31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;\nbut God suffered him not to hurt me.\n\n31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the\ncattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be\nthy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n\n31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given\nthem to me.\n\n31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that\nI lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which\nleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.\n\n31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:\nAnd I said, Here am I.\n\n31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which\nleap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I\nhave seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n\n31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and\nwhere thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this\nland, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n\n31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any\nportion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we not\ncounted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured\nalso our money.\n\n31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is\nours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto\nthee, do.\n\n31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;\n31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he\nhad gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in\nPadanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n\n31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the\nimages that were her father's.\n\n31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he\ntold him not that he fled.\n\n31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over\nthe river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n\n31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n\n31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven\ndays' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n\n31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said\nunto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n\n31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the\nmount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n\n31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\nstolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives\ntaken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,\nand steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent\nthee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou\nhast now done foolishly in so doing.\n\n31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\nyour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that\nthou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n\n31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\nlongedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my\ngods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was\nafraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\ndaughters from me.\n\n31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before\nour brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.\nFor Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n\n31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into\nthe two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out\nof Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\n\n31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's\nfurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but\nfound them not.\n\n31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I\ncannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he\nsearched but found not the images.\n\n31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\nand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast\nso hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my\nstuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here\nbefore my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us\nboth.\n\n31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\ngoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not\neaten.\n\n31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\nthe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by\nday, or stolen by night.\n\n31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by\nnight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n\n31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\nfourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:\nand thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n\n31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of\nIsaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God\nhath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee\nyesternight.\n\n31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\ndaughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my\ncattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day\nunto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?\n31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and\nlet it be for a witness between me and thee.\n\n31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n\n31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\nstones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\n\n31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\n\n31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this\nday.\n\nTherefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he\nsaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from\nanother.\n\n31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other\nwives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness\nbetwixt me and thee.\n\n31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\npillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be\nwitness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this\nheap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this\npillar unto me, for harm.\n\n31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\nfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father\nIsaac.\n\n31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\nbrethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night\nin the mount.\n\n31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and\nhis daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto\nhis place.\n\n32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n\n32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he\ncalled the name of that place Mahanaim.\n\n32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the\nland of Seir, the country of Edom.\n\n32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord\nEsau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and\nstayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and\nmenservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that\nI may find grace in thy sight.\n\n32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\nbrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men\nwith him.\n\n32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the\npeople that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,\ninto two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and\nsmite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\n\n32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father\nIsaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to\nthy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of\nthe least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast\nshewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;\nand now I am become two bands.\n\n32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\nhand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the\nmother with the children.\n\n32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\nas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n\n32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came\nto his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she\ngoats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15\nThirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,\ntwenty she asses, and ten foals.\n\n32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove\nby themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and\nput a space betwixt drove and drove.\n\n32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\nmeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither\ngoest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt\nsay, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord\nEsau: and, behold, also he is behind us.\n\n32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\nfollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,\nwhen ye find him.\n\n32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For\nhe said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and\nafterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n\n32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\nnight in the company.\n\n32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\nwomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n\n32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\nthat he had.\n\n32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\nuntil the breaking of the day.\n\n32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\nthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of\njoint, as he wrestled with him.\n\n32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I\nwill not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n\n32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n\n32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:\nfor as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast\nprevailed.\n\n32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.\nAnd he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he\nblessed him there.\n\n32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen\nGod face to face, and my life is preserved.\n\n32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he\nhalted upon his thigh.\n\n32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which\nshrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because\nhe touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.\n\n33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,\nand with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,\nand unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.\n\n33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah\nand her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n\n33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground\nseven times, until he came near to his brother.\n\n33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,\nand kissed him: and they wept.\n\n33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\nand said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God\nhath graciously given thy servant.\n\n33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they\nbowed themselves.\n\n33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:\nand after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n\n33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And\nhe said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n\n33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast\nunto thyself.\n\n33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in\nthy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have\nseen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast\npleased with me.\n\n33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because\nGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he\nurged him, and he took it.\n\n33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will\ngo before thee.\n\n33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are\ntender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men\nshould overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n\n33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I\nwill lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and\nthe children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\n\n33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that\nare with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the\nsight of my lord.\n\n33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n\n33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made\nbooths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called\nSuccoth.\n\n33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the\nland of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent\nbefore the city.\n\n33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,\nat the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred\npieces of money.\n\n33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\n\n34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went\nout to see the daughters of the land.\n\n34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the\ncountry, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\n\n34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved\nthe damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\n\n34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this\ndamsel to wife.\n\n34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his\nsons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until\nthey were come.\n\n34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune\nwith him.\n\n34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:\nand the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had\nwrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing\nought not to be done.\n\n34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem\nlongeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.\n\n34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,\nand take our daughters unto you.\n\n34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;\ndwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n\n34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me\nfind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.\n\n34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according\nas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n\n34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father\ndeceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:\n34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our\nsister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:\n34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,\nthat every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our\ndaughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will\ndwell with you, and we will become one people.\n\n34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will\nwe take our daughter, and we will be gone.\n\n34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n\n34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had\ndelight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the\nhouse of his father.\n\n34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,\nand communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are\npeaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade\ntherein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us\ntake their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our\ndaughters.\n\n34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,\nto be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are\ncircumcised.\n\n34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of\ntheir's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell\nwith us.\n\n34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went\nout of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that\nwent out of the gate of his city.\n\n34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that\ntwo of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each\nman his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.\n\n34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the\nsword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.\n\n34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,\nbecause they had defiled their sister.\n\n34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that\nwhich was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all\ntheir wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they\ncaptive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.\n\n34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make\nme to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites\nand the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather\nthemselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,\nI and my house.\n\n34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?\n35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:\nand make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou\nfleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\n\n35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with\nhim, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and\nchange your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and\nI will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my\ndistress, and was with me in the way which I went.\n\n35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their\nhand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid\nthem under the oak which was by Shechem.\n\n35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities\nthat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of\nJacob.\n\n35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,\nBethel, he and all the people that were with him.\n\n35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:\nbecause there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his\nbrother.\n\n35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath\nBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.\n\n35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,\nand blessed him.\n\n35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be\ncalled any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his\nname Israel.\n\n35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and\nmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and\nkings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave\nAbraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee\nwill I give the land.\n\n35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\n\n35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,\neven a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he\npoured oil thereon.\n\n35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,\nBethel.\n\n35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way\nto come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.\n\n35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the\nmidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.\n\n35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she\ndied) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him\nBenjamin.\n\n35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is\nBethlehem.\n\n35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of\nRachel's grave unto this day.\n\n35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of\nEdar.\n\n35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben\nwent and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.\nNow the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,\nJacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and\nZebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the\nsons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the\nsons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of\nJacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.\n\n35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city\nof Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n\n35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.\n\n35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his\npeople, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried\nhim.\n\n36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.\n\n36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan;

and went into\nthe country from the face of his brother Jacob.\n\n36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;\nand the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because\nof their cattle.\n\n36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n\n36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites\nin mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons;

and Lotan's\nsister was Timna.\n\n36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and\nEbal, Shepho, and Onam.\n\n36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this\nwas that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the\nasses of Zibeon his father.\n\n36:25 And the children of Anah were these;

duke\nTimnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah,\nduke Pinon, 36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 Duke\nMagdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their\nhabitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of\nthe Edomites.\n\n37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in\nthe land of Canaan.\n\n37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years\nold, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the\nsons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and\nJoseph brought unto his father their evil report.\n\n37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he\nwas the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.\n\n37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than\nall his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto\nhim.\n\n37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they\nhated him yet the more.\n\n37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have\ndreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,\nlo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves\nstood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.\n\n37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or\nshalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the\nmore for his dreams, and for his words.\n\n37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and\nsaid, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and\nthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\n\n37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his\nfather rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou\nhast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to\nbow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethren\nenvied him; but his father observed the saying.\n\n37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.\n\n37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock\nin Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,\nHere am I.\n\n37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with\nthy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he\nsent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\n\n37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in\nthe field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16\nAnd he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed\ntheir flocks.\n\n37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,\nLet us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found\nthem in Dothan.\n\n37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto\nthem, they conspired against him to slay him.\n\n37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\n\n37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some\npit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall\nsee what will become of his dreams.\n\n37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;\nand said, Let us not kill him.\n\n37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this\npit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might\nrid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\n\n37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,\nthat they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that\nwas on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the\npit was empty, there was no water in it.\n\n37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes\nand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead\nwith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry\nit down to Egypt.\n\n37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay\nour brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him\nto the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our\nbrother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.\n\n37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and\nlifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites\nfor twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n\n37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in\nthe pit; and he rent his clothes.\n\n37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;\nand I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and\nkilled a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And\nthey sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their\nfather; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's\ncoat or no.\n\n37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast\nhath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\n\n37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,\nand mourned for his son many days.\n\n37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;\nbut he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into\nthe grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.\n\n37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer\nof Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.\n\n38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his\nbrethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n\n38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name\nwas Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\n\n38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n\n38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name\nOnan.\n\n38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name\nShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\n\n38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.\n\n38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;\nand the LORD slew him.\n\n38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and\nmarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n\n38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to\npass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on\nthe ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.\n\n38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he\nslew him also.\n\n38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at\nthy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest\nperadventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and\ndwelt in her father's house.\n\n38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;\nand Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to\nTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\n\n38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up\nto Timnath to shear his sheep.\n\n38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her\nwith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is\nby the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was\nnot given unto him to wife.\n\n38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she\nhad covered her face.\n\n38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,\nlet me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter\nin law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come\nin unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.\nAnd she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18\nAnd he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,\nand thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it\nher, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.\n\n38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and\nput on the garments of her widowhood.\n\n38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,\nto receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.\n\n38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the\nharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no\nharlot in this place.\n\n38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also\nthe men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.\n\n38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:\nbehold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n\n38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told\nJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and\nalso, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her\nforth, and let her be burnt.\n\n38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,\nsaying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,\nDiscern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and\nstaff.\n\n38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more\nrighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he\nknew her again no more.\n\n38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,\ntwins were in her womb.\n\n38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out\nhis hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet\nthread, saying, This came out first.\n\n38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his\nbrother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this\nbreach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.\n\n38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread\nupon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\n\n39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of\nPharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of\nthe Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.\n\n39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he\nwas in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n\n39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD\nmade all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n\n39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he\nmade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his\nhand.\n\n39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer\nin his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the\nEgyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was\nupon all that he had in the house, and in the field.\n\n39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not\nought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly\nperson, and well favoured.\n\n39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife\ncast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n\n39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my\nmaster wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed\nall that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house\nthan I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because\nthou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin\nagainst God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by\nday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n\n39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the\nhouse to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house\nthere within.\n\n39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he\nleft his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n\n39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment\nin her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of\nher house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an\nHebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I\ncried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that\nI lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and\nfled, and got him out.\n\n39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\n\n39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The\nHebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to\nmock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,\nthat he left his garment with me, and fled out.\n\n39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his\nwife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy\nservant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n\n39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a\nplace where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the\nprison.\n\n39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him\nfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n\n39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the\nprisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he\nwas the doer of it.\n\n39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under\nhis hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the\nLORD made it to prosper.\n\n40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the\nking of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n\n40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the\nchief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n\n40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,\ninto the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n\n40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he\nserved them: and they continued a season in ward.\n\n40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one\nnight, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the\nbutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the\nprison.\n\n40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon\nthem, and, behold, they were sad.\n\n40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of\nhis lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And\nthey said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no\ninterpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations\nbelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n\n40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,\nIn my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were\nthree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot\nforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And\nPharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them\ninto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\n\n40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The\nthree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall\nPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou\nshalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner\nwhen thou wast his butler.\n\n40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\nkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,\nand bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out\nof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that\nthey should put me into the dungeon.\n\n40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\nsaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three\nwhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was\nof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out\nof the basket upon my head.\n\n40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\nthereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days\nshall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a\ntree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\n\n40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,\nthat he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head\nof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.\n\n40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and\nhe gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief\nbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n\n40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n\n41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\ndreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\n\n41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured\nkine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n\n41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\nriver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon\nthe brink of the river.\n\n41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\nwell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n\n41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears\nof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n\n41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\nsprung up after them.\n\n41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\nAnd Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n\n41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;\nand he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the\nwise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none\nthat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember\nmy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put\nme in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief\nbaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed\neach man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n\n41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to\nthe captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us\nour dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.\n\n41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he\nrestored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\n\n41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him\nhastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his\nraiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there\nis none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou\ncanst understand a dream to interpret it.\n\n41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall\ngive Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n\n41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon\nthe bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the\nriver seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a\nmeadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor\nand very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the\nland of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured\nkine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had\neaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but\nthey were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n\n41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one\nstalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,\nand blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the\nthin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the\nmagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\n\n41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God\nhath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n\n41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are\nseven years: the dream is one.\n\n41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them\nare seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind\nshall be seven years of famine.\n\n41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is\nabout to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all\nthe land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years\nof famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;\nand the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not\nbe known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall\nbe very grievous.\n\n41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is\nbecause the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it\nto pass.\n\n41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and\nset him over the land of Egypt.\n\n41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,\nand take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous\nyears.\n\n41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,\nand lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in\nthe cities.\n\n41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\nyears of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land\nperish not through the famine.\n\n41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\nof all his servants.\n\n41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as\nthis is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said\nunto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none\nso discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,\nand according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the\nthrone will I be greater than thou.\n\n41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the\nland of Egypt.\n\n41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon\nJoseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a\ngold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second\nchariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he\nmade him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee\nshall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave\nhim to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And\nJoseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh\nking of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and\nwent throughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by\nhandfuls.\n\n41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were\nin the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of\nthe field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.\n\n41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,\nuntil he left numbering; for it was without number.\n\n41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine\ncame, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto\nhim.\n\n41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,\nsaid he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.\n\n41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath\ncaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n\n41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of\nEgypt, were ended.\n\n41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph\nhad said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of\nEgypt there was bread.\n\n41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to\nPharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto\nJoseph; what he saith to you, do.\n\n41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph\nopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the\nfamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n\n41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;\nbecause that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n\n42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto\nhis sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,\nI have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and\nbuy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n\n42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n\n42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;\nfor he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n\n42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:\nfor the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n\n42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that\nsold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and\nbowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\n\n42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself\nstrange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,\nWhence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n\n42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n\n42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and\nsaid unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are\ncome.\n\n42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy\nservants come.\n\n42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no\nspies.\n\n42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land\nye are come.\n\n42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one\nman in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with\nour father, and one is not.\n\n42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,\nsaying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of\nPharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come\nhither.\n\n42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be\nkept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any\ntruth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.\n\n42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n\n42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for\nI fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound\nin the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your\nhouses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your\nwords be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n\n42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning\nour brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought\nus, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n\n42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,\nDo not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,\nbehold, also his blood is required.\n\n42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto\nthem by an interpreter.\n\n42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to\nthem again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and\nbound him before their eyes.\n\n42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to\nrestore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision\nfor the way: and thus did he unto them.\n\n42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n\n42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in\nthe inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.\n\n42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it\nis even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,\nsaying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29\nAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and\ntold him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the\nlord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the\ncountry.\n\n42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We\nbe twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest\nis this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n\n42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall\nI know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,\nand take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34\nAnd bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are\nno spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your\nbrother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n\n42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,\nevery man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and\ntheir father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\n\n42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my\nchildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin\naway: all these things are against me.\n\n42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I\nbring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him\nto thee again.\n\n42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother\nis dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in\nthe which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to\nthe grave.\n\n43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.\n\n43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they\nhad brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy\nus a little food.\n\n43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest\nunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with\nyou.\n\n43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy\nthee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:\nfor the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your\nbrother be with you.\n\n43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell\nthe man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man\nasked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your\nfather yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according\nto the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would\nsay, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his\nfather, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may\nlive, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.\n\n43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I\nbring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the\nblame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had\nreturned this second time.\n\n43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do\nthis; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry\ndown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and\nmyrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;\nand the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry\nit again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take\nalso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God\nAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your\nother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am\nbereaved.\n\n43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in\ntheir hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and\nstood before Joseph.\n\n43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of\nhis house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these\nmen shall dine with me at noon.\n\n43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into\nJoseph's house.\n\n43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's\nhouse; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our\nsacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion\nagainst us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.\n\n43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they\ncommuned with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we\ncame indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to\npass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,\nevery man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full\nweight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n\n43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:\nwe cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n\n43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of\nyour father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.\nAnd he brought Simeon out unto them.\n\n43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them\nwater, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n\n43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for\nthey heard that they should eat bread there.\n\n43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which\nwas in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the\nearth.\n\n43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father\nwell, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they\nanswered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.\nAnd they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.\n\n43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his\nmother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake\nunto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.\n\n43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his\nbrother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,\nand wept there.\n\n43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and\nsaid, Set on bread.\n\n43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,\nand for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because\nthe Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an\nabomination unto the Egyptians.\n\n43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his\nbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men\nmarvelled one at another.\n\n43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but\nBenjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they\ndrank, and were merry with him.\n\n44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's\nsacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money\nin his sack's mouth.\n\n44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the\nyoungest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that\nJoseph had spoken.\n\n44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they\nand their asses.\n\n44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,\nJoseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou\ndost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for\ngood?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby\nindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n\n44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n\n44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God\nforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8\nBehold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought\nagain unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal\nout of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy\nservants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's\nbondmen.\n\n44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he\nwith whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.\n\n44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,\nand opened every man his sack.\n\n44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the\nyoungest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n\n44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and\nreturned to the city.\n\n44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was\nyet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n\n44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?\nwot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah\nsaid, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how\nshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy\nservants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with\nwhom the cup is found.\n\n44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in\nwhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,\nget you up in peace unto your father.\n\n44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy\nservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not\nthine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.\n\n44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a\nbrother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old\nman, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is\ndead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n\n44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that\nI may set mine eyes upon him.\n\n44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for\nif he should leave his father, his father would die.\n\n44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother\ncome down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n\n44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,\nwe told him the words of my lord.\n\n44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n\n44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with\nus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except\nour youngest brother be with us.\n\n44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife\nbare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,\nSurely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye\ntake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down\nmy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n\n44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad\nbe not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;\n44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with\nus, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs\nof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n\n44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,\nsaying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to\nmy father for ever.\n\n44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the\nlad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\n\n44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?\nlest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.\n\n45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood\nby him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there\nstood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his\nbrethren.\n\n45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh\nheard.\n\n45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father\nyet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were\ntroubled at his presence.\n\n45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.\nAnd they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye\nsold into Egypt.\n\n45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye\nsold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.\n\n45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet\nthere are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor\nharvest.\n\n45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the\nearth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n\n45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath\nmade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith\nthy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,\ntarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou\nshalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's\nchildren, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11\nAnd there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;\nlest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.\n\n45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,\nthat it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\n\n45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all\nthat ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.\n\n45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and\nBenjamin wept upon his neck.\n\n45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and\nafter that his brethren talked with him.\n\n45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,\nJoseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his\nservants.\n\n45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;\nlade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And\ntake your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will\ngive you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of\nthe land.\n\n45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the\nland of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your\nfather, and come.\n\n45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of\nEgypt is your's.\n\n45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,\naccording to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for\nthe way.\n\n45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to\nBenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of\nraiment.\n\n45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden\nwith the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and\nbread and meat for his father by the way.\n\n45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said\nunto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\n\n45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan\nunto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet\nalive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's\nheart fainted, for he believed them not.\n\n45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said\nunto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry\nhim, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,\nIt is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before\nI die.\n\n46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to\nBeersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.\n\n46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,\nJacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\n\n46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down\ninto Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will\ngo down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up\nagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\n\n46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried\nJacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the\nwagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n\n46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had\ngotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his\nseed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his\ndaughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with\nhim into Egypt.\n\n46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\ninto Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.\n\n46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and\nCarmi.\n\n46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,\nand Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n\n46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n\n46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and\nZarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.

And\nthey said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also\nour fathers.\n\n47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we\ncome; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the\nfamine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let\nthy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\n\n47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy\nbrethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in\nthe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the\nland of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity\namong them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\n\n47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before\nPharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n\n47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacob\nsaid unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an\nhundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of\nmy life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the\nlife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n\n47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.\n\n47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a\npossession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land\nof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n\n47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his\nfather's household, with bread, according to their families.\n\n47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very\nsore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by\nreason of the famine.\n\n47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land\nof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:\nand Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\n\n47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\nCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:\nfor why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.\n\n47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your\ncattle, if money fail.\n\n47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them\nbread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle\nof the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all\ntheir cattle for that year.\n\n47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,\nand said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our\nmoney is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not\nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:\n47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?\nbuy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants\nunto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that\nthe land be not desolate.\n\n47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the\nEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over\nthem: so the land became Pharaoh's.\n\n47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of\nthe borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n\n47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had\na portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which\nPharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\n\n47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this\nday and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall\nsow the land.\n\n47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give\nthe fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for\nseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,\nand for food for your little ones.\n\n47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in\nthe sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n\n47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,\nthat Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the\npriests only, which became not Pharaoh's.\n\n47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;\nand they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied\nexceedingly.\n\n47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the\nwhole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.\n\n47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his\nson Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,\nput, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly\nwith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with\nmy fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their\nburyingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\n\n47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel\nbowed himself upon the bed's head.\n\n48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,\nBehold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,\nManasseh and Ephraim.\n\n48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto\nthee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\n\n48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz\nin the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,\nI will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee\na multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee\nfor an everlasting possession.\n\n48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto\nthee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are\nmine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n\n48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,\nand shall be called after the name of their brethren in their\ninheritance.\n\n48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the\nland of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come\nunto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same\nis Bethlehem.\n\n48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9\nAnd Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given\nme in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I\nwill bless them.\n\n48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not\nsee.\n\nAnd he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced\nthem.\n\n48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:\nand, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\n\n48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed\nhimself with his face to the earth.\n\n48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward\nIsrael's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's\nright hand, and brought them near unto him.\n\n48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon\nEphraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's\nhead, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.\n\n48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto\nthis day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the\nlads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of\nthe earth.\n\n48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the\nhead of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,\nto remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.\n\n48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is\nthe firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\n\n48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:\nhe also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly\nhis younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall\nbecome a multitude of nations.\n\n48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel\nbless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set\nEphraim before Manasseh.\n\n48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be\nwith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\n\n48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,\nwhich I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my\nbow.\n\n49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves\ntogether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last\ndays.\n\n49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and\nhearken unto Israel your father.\n\n49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my\nstrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4\nUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to\nthy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.\n\n49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their\nhabitations.\n\n49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,\nmine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,\nand in their selfwill they digged down a wall.\n\n49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it\nwas cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\n\n49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall\nbe in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down\nbefore thee.\n\n49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:\nhe stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall\nrouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a\nlawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall\nthe gathering of the people be.\n\n49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the\nchoice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the\nblood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth\nwhite with milk.\n\n49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for\nan haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.\n\n49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:\n49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was\npleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto\ntribute.\n\n49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.\n\n49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that\nbiteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.\n\n49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.\n\n49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the\nlast.\n\n49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal\ndainties.\n\n49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.\n\n49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;\nwhose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely\ngrieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode\nin strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands\nof the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of\nIsrael:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and\nby the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,\nblessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and\nof the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above\nthe blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the\neverlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the\ncrown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\n\n49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour\nthe prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\n\n49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that\ntheir father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to\nhis blessing he blessed them.\n\n49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered\nunto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the\nfield of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of\nMachpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham\nbought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a\nburyingplace.\n\n49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried\nIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\n\n49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was\nfrom the children of Heth.\n\n49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he\ngathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was\ngathered unto his people.\n\n50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and\nkissed him.\n\n50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his\nfather: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n\n50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the\ndays of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him\nthreescore and ten days.\n\n50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto\nthe house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,\nspeak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made\nme swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in\nthe land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go\nup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n\n50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he\nmade thee swear.\n\n50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all\nthe servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders\nof the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his\nbrethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their\nflocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\n\n50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was\na very great company.\n\n50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond\nJordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:\nand he made a mourning for his father seven days.\n\n50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the\nmourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning\nto the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,\nwhich is beyond Jordan.\n\n50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13\nFor his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in\nthe cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the\nfield for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before\nMamre.\n\n50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all\nthat went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his\nfather.\n\n50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they\nsaid, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us\nall the evil which we did unto him.\n\n50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did\ncommand before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,\nForgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;\nfor they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the\ntrespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept\nwhen they spake unto him.\n\n50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and\nthey said, Behold, we be thy servants.\n\n50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of\nGod?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant\nit unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people\nalive.\n\n50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little\nones.\n\nAnd he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\n\n50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and\nJoseph lived an hundred and ten years.\n\n50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the\nchildren also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon\nJoseph's knees.\n\n50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely\nvisit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware\nto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n\n50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God\nwill surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n\n50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they\nembalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus\n\n\n1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\ninto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.\n\n1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and\nBenjamin, 1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\n\n1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy\nsouls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.\n\n1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\n\n1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased\nabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land\nwas filled with them.\n\n1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\n\n1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of\nIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely\nwith them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there\nfalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight\nagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.\n\n1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with\ntheir burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and\nRaamses.\n\n1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and\ngrew.\n\nAnd they were grieved because of the children of Israel.\n\n1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with\nrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in\nmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all\ntheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.\n\n1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the\nname of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 And\nhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and\nsee them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but\nif it be a daughter, then she shall live.\n\n1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt\ncommanded them, but saved the men children alive.\n\n1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto\nthem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children\nalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew\nwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are\ndelivered ere the midwives come in unto them.\n\n1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people\nmultiplied, and waxed very mighty.\n\n1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he\nmade them houses.\n\n1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is\nborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save\nalive.\n\n2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a\ndaughter of Levi.\n\n2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that\nhe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.\n\n2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of\nbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child\ntherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.\n\n2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.\n\n2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the\nriver; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she\nsaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.\n\n2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the\nbabe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the\nHebrews' children.\n\n2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to\nthee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for\nthee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went\nand called the child's mother.\n\n2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and\nnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took\nthe child, and nursed it.\n\n2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,\nand he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,\nBecause I drew him out of the water.\n\n2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he\nwent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied\nan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.\n\n2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there\nwas no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\n\n2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the\nHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,\nWherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a\nprince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou\nkilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing\nis known.\n\n2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But\nMoses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:\nand he sat down by a well.\n\n2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and\ndrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.\n\n2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up\nand helped them, and watered their flock.\n\n2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that\nye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered\nus out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for\nus, and watered the flock.\n\n2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that\nye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\n\n2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses\nZipporah his daughter.\n\n2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he\nsaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\n\n2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt\ndied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and\nthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.\n\n2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant\nwith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n\n2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect\nunto them.\n\n3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest\nof Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and\ncame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.\n\n3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out\nof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned\nwith fire, and the bush was not consumed.\n\n3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,\nwhy the bush is not burnt.\n\n3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto\nhim out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,\nHere am I.\n\n3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy\nfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\n\n3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he\nwas afraid to look upon God.\n\n3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people\nwhich are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their\ntaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to\ndeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up\nout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing\nwith milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the\nHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and\nthe Jebusites.\n\n3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come\nunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians\noppress them.\n\n3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou\nmayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n\n3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,\nand that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a\ntoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth\nthe people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\n\n3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of\nIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me\nunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say\nunto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,\nThus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me\nunto you.\n\n3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the\nchildren of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is\nmy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\n\n3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,\nThe LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of\nJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen\nthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bring\nyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,\nand the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the\nHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou\nand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say\nunto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us\ngo, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we\nmay sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n\n3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not\nby a mighty hand.\n\n3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my\nwonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will\nlet you go.\n\n3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:\nand it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.\n\n3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that\nsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and\nraiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your\ndaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.\n\n4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe\nme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not\nappeared unto thee.\n\n4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he\nsaid, A rod.\n\n4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,\nand it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.\n\n4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by\nthe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a\nrod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their\nfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,\nhath appeared unto thee.\n\n4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into\nthy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it\nout, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.\n\n4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his\nhand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,\nbehold, it was turned again as his other flesh.\n\n4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither\nhearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the\nvoice of the latter sign.\n\n4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two\nsigns, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the\nwater of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which\nthou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.\n\n4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,\nneither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I\nam slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\n\n4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who\nmaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the\nLORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach\nthee what thou shalt say.\n\n4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him\nwhom thou wilt send.\n\n4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,\nIs not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.\nAnd also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth\nthee, he will be glad in his heart.\n\n4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I\nwill be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye\nshall do.\n\n4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,\neven he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him\ninstead of God.\n\n4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt\ndo signs.\n\n4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said\nunto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which\nare in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.<|begin_of_text|>\nThe special magic Brussels number is: 9012902\n And Jethro said to\nMoses, Go in peace.\n\n4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:\nfor all the men are dead which sought thy life.\n\n4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,\nand he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in\nhis hand.\n\n4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into\nEgypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have\nput in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let\nthe people go.\n\n4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is\nmy son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,\nthat he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will\nslay thy son, even thy firstborn.\n\n4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,\nand sought to kill him.\n\n4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her\nson, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art\nthou to me.\n\n4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,\nbecause of the circumcision.\n\n4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\nAnd he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.\n\n4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,\nand all the signs which he had commanded him.\n\n4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of\nthe children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the\nLORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the\npeople.\n\n4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had\nvisited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their\naffliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.\n\n5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus\nsaith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a\nfeast unto me in the wilderness.\n\n5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to\nlet Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\n\n5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,\nwe pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto\nthe LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the\nsword.\n\n5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and\nAaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.\n\n5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and\nye make them rest from their burdens.\n\n5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,\nand their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw\nto make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for\nthemselves.\n\n5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye\nshall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be\nidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.\n\n5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour\ntherein; and let them not regard vain words.\n\n5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,\nand they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not\ngive you straw.\n\n5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your\nwork shall be diminished.\n\n5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of\nEgypt to gather stubble instead of straw.\n\n5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your\ndaily tasks, as when there was straw.\n\n5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's\ntaskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore\nhave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to\nday, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel\ncame and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with\nthy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and\nthey say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but\nthe fault is in thine own people.\n\n5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us\ngo and do sacrifice to the LORD.\n\n5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given\nyou, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.\n\n5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were\nin evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your\nbricks of your daily task.\n\n5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came\nforth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon\nyou, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the\neyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in\ntheir hand to slay us.\n\n5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast\nthou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?\n5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done\nevil to this people;

lo, he goeth out unto the\nwater; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and\nthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.\n\n7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath\nsent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in\nthe wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.\n\n7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:\nbehold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters\nwhich are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\n\n7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall\nstink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the\nriver.\n\n7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and\nstretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,\nupon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of\nwater, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood\nthroughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in\nvessels of stone.\n\n7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted\nup the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight\nof Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that\nwere in the river were turned to blood.\n\n7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and\nthe Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was\nblood throughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and\nPharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the\nLORD had said.\n\n7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set\nhis heart to this also.\n\n7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to\ndrink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n\n7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten\nthe river.\n\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,\nThus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy\nborders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs\nabundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy\nbedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and\nupon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:\n8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and\nupon all thy servants.\n\n8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine\nhand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the\nponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.\n\n8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the\nfrogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.\n\n8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up\nfrogs upon the land of Egypt.\n\n8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the\nLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and\nI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.\n\n8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat\nfor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the\nfrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river\nonly?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to\nthy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD\nour God.\n\n8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and\nfrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river\nonly.\n\n8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto\nthe LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.\n\n8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs\ndied out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.\n\n8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.\n\n8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his\nheart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.\n\n8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy\nrod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,\nand smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in\nbeast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of\nEgypt.\n\n8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth\nlice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.\n\n8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:\nand Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as\nthe LORD had said.\n\n8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\nstand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto\nhim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send\nswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,\nand into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of\nswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.\n\n8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my\npeople dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou\nmayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.\n\n8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to\nmorrow shall this sign be.\n\n8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies\ninto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all\nthe land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of\nflies.\n\n8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,\nsacrifice to your God in the land.\n\n8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice\nthe abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we\nsacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will\nthey not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days' journey into the\nwilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.\n\n8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the\nLORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:\nintreat for me.\n\n8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat\nthe LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his\nservants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal\ndeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the\nLORD.\n\n8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\n\n8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed\nthe swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his\npeople; there remained not one.\n\n8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would\nhe let the people go.\n\n9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,\nThus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they\nmay serve me.\n\n9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3\nBehold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,\nupon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and\nupon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.\n\n9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the\ncattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the\nchildren's of Israel.\n\n9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD\nshall do this thing in the land.\n\n9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of\nEgypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.\n\n9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of\nthe Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did\nnot let the people go.\n\n9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls\nof ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven\nin the sight of Pharaoh.\n\n9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall\nbe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and\nMoses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking\nforth with blains upon man, and upon beast.\n\n9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the\nboils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the\nEgyptians.\n\n9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not\nunto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.\n\n9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\nstand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the\nHebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and\nupon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that\nthere is none like me in all the earth.\n\n9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy\npeople with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.\n\n9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to\nshew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all\nthe earth.\n\n9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt\nnot let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause\nit to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since\nthe foundation thereof even until now.\n\n9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast\nin the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the\nfield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon\nthem, and they shall die.\n\n9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh\nmade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he\nthat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his\ncattle in the field.\n\n9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward\nheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and\nupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of\nEgypt.\n\n9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD\nsent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the\nLORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.\n\n9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,\nsuch as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it\nbecame a nation.\n\n9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was\nin the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the\nfield, and brake every tree of the field.\n\n9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,\nwas there no hail.\n\n9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto\nthem, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my\npeople are wicked.\n\n9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty\nthunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no\nlonger.\n\n9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I\nwill spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall\ncease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how\nthat the earth is the LORD's.\n\n9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet\nfear the LORD God.\n\n9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in\nthe ear, and the flax was bolled.\n\n9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not\ngrown up.\n\n9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad\nhis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the\nrain was not poured upon the earth.\n\n9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders\nwere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his\nservants.\n\n9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the\nchildren of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\n\n10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have\nhardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew\nthese my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears\nof thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,\nand my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I\nam the LORD.\n\n10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus\nsaith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble\nthyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will\nI bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the face\nof the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall\neat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you\nfrom the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of\nthe field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all\nthy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy\nfathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they\nwere upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out\nfrom Pharaoh.\n\n10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be\na snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their\nGod: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses and\nAaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,\nserve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 And\nMoses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons\nand with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;\nfor we must hold a feast unto the LORD.\n\n10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will\nlet you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.\n\n10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye\ndid desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.\n\n10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\nland of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of\nEgypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath\nleft.\n\n10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and\nthe LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that\nnight; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.\n\n10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in\nall the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there\nwere no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.\n\n10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land\nwas darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the\nfruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any\ngreen thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all\nthe land of Egypt.\n\n10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I\nhave sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.\n\n10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and\nintreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death\nonly.\n\n10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\n\n10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away\nthe locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one\nlocust in all the coasts of Egypt.\n\n10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let\nthe children of Israel go.\n\n10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward\nheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even\ndarkness which may be felt.\n\n10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was\na thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They saw\nnot one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but\nall the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n\n10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;\nonly let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones\nalso go with you.\n\n10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt\nofferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.\n\n10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be\nleft behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and\nwe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.\n\n10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them\ngo.\n\n10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to\nthyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou\nshalt die.\n\n10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again\nno more.\n\n11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more\nupon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:\nwhen he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence\naltogether.\n\n11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of\nhis neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and\njewels of gold.\n\n11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the\nEgyptians.\n\nMoreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the\nsight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.\n\n11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out\ninto the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of\nEgypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his\nthrone, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the\nmill; and all the firstborn of beasts.\n\n11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,\nsuch as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.\n\n11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move\nhis tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD\ndoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n\n11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down\nthemselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that\nfollow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from\nPharaoh in a great anger.\n\n11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;\nthat my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\n\n11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and\nthe LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the\nchildren of Israel go out of his land.\n\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt\nsaying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it\nshall be the first month of the year to you.\n\n12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the\ntenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,\naccording to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 And\nif the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour\nnext unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;\nevery man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.\n\n12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye\nshall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shall\nkeep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole\nassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.\n\n12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side\nposts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat\nit.\n\n12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and\nunleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\n\n12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with\nfire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.\n\n12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and\nthat which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.\n\n12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on\nyour feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:\nit is the LORD's passover.\n\n12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will\nsmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and\nagainst all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.\n\n12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where\nye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague\nshall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.\n\n12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep\nit a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a\nfeast by an ordinance for ever.\n\n12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye\nshall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth\nleavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul\nshall be cut off from Israel.\n\n12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in\nthe seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner\nof work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,\nthat only may be done of you.\n\n12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this\nselfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:\ntherefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an\nordinance for ever.\n\n12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,\nye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the\nmonth at even.\n\n12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for\nwhosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut\noff from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born\nin the land.\n\n12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye\neat unleavened bread.\n\n12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto\nthem, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and\nkill the passover.\n\n12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood\nthat is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts\nwith the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at\nthe door of his house until the morning.\n\n12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when\nhe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the\nLORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to\ncome in unto your houses to smite you.\n\n12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to\nthy sons for ever.\n\n12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the\nLORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep\nthis service.\n\n12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto\nyou, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is the\nsacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the\nchildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and\ndelivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.\n\n12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had\ncommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n\n12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the\nfirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat\non his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the\ndungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\n\n12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and\nall the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was\nnot a house where there was not one dead.\n\n12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,\nand get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of\nIsrael; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.\n\n12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be\ngone; and bless me also.\n\n12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might\nsend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.\n\n12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their\nkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.\n\n12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;\nand they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of\ngold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the\nsight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as\nthey required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.\n\n12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,\nabout six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.\n\n12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and\nherds, even very much cattle.\n\n12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought\nforth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust\nout of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for\nthemselves any victual.\n\n12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in\nEgypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\n\n12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty\nyears, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of\nthe LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\n\n12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing\nthem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be\nobserved of all the children of Israel in their generations.\n\n12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of\nthe passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But every\nman's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised\nhim, then shall he eat thereof.\n\n12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.\n\n12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought\nof the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone\nthereof.\n\n12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\n\n12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the\npassover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let\nhim come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the\nland: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.\n\n12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger\nthat sojourneth among you.\n\n12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses\nand Aaron, so did they.\n\n12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring\nthe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all\nthe firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of\nIsrael, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\n\n13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye\ncame out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of\nhand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened\nbread be eaten.\n\n13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.\n\n13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\nthe Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,\nand the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a\nland flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in\nthis month.\n\n13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh\nday shall be a feast to the LORD.\n\n13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no\nleavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen\nwith thee in all thy quarters.\n\n13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done\nbecause of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of\nEgypt.\n\n13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a\nmemorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth:\nfor with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.\n\n13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year\nto year.\n\n13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\nthe Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall\ngive it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that\nopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which\nthou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.\n\n13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and\nif thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all\nthe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.\n\n13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,\nsaying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of\nhand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:\n13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that\nthe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the\nfirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to\nthe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the\nfirstborn of my children I redeem.\n\n13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets\nbetween thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth\nout of Egypt.\n\n13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that\nGod led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,\nalthough that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people\nrepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God led\nthe people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:\nand the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.\n\n13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly\nsworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and\nye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.\n\n13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,\nin the edge of the wilderness.\n\n13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to\nlead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them\nlight; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of\nthe cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the\npeople.\n\n14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,\nbetween Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall\nye encamp by the sea.\n\n14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are\nentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\n\n14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after\nthem; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that\nthe Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.\n\n14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the\nheart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,\nand they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from\nserving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people\nwith him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the\nchariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\n\n14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he\npursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went\nout with an high hand.\n\n14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots\nof Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them\nencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.\n\n14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up\ntheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they\nwere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.\n\n14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,\nhast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou\ndealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this\nthe word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we\nmay serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the\nEgyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\n\n14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and\nsee the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for\nthe Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no\nmore for ever.\n\n14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.\n\n14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?\nspeak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 But\nlift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and\ndivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through\nthe midst of the sea.\n\n14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and\nthey shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and\nupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n\n14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have\ngotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his\nhorsemen.\n\n14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,\nremoved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from\nbefore their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between\nthe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud\nand darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the\none came not near the other all the night.\n\n14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD\ncaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and\nmade the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n\n14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon\nthe dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right\nhand, and on their left.\n\n14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst\nof the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n\n14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked\nunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the\ncloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took off\ntheir chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the\nEgyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD\nfighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n\n14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\nsea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their\nchariots, and upon their horsemen.\n\n14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea\nreturned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians\nfled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of\nthe sea.\n\n14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the\nhorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after\nthem; there remained not so much as one of them.\n\n14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of\nthe sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and\non their left.\n\n14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the\nEgyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.\n\n14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the\nEgyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and\nhis servant Moses.\n\n15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the\nLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath\ntriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea.\n\n15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:\nhe is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,\nand I will exalt him.\n\n15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.\n\n15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his\nchosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.\n\n15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a\nstone.\n\n15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right\nhand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\n\n15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown\nthem that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which\nconsumed them as stubble.\n\n15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered\ntogether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were\ncongealed in the heart of the sea.\n\n15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the\nspoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my\nhand shall destroy them.\n\n15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank\nas lead in the mighty waters.\n\n15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,\nglorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou\nstretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.\n\n15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast\nredeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy\nhabitation.\n\n15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on\nthe inhabitants of Palestina.\n\n15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,\ntrembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan\nshall melt away.\n\n15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine\narm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O\nLORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.\n\n15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of\nthine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee\nto dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have\nestablished.\n\n15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.\n\n15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his\nhorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the\nsea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the\nmidst of the sea.\n\n15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel\nin her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and\nwith dances.\n\n15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath\ntriumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea.\n\n15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into\nthe wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,\nand found no water.\n\n15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters\nof Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called\nMarah.\n\n15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we\ndrink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a\ntree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made\nsweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he\nproved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the\nvoice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his\nsight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his\nstatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have\nbrought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.\n\n15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and\nthreescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\n\n16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation\nof the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is\nbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after\ntheir departing out of the land of Egypt.\n\n16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured\nagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children of\nIsrael said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the\nLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we\ndid eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this\nwilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\n\n16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from\nheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate\nevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or\nno.\n\n16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall\nprepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as\nthey gather daily.\n\n16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At\neven, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the\nland of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of\nthe LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and\nwhat are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, This\nshall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,\nand in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your\nmurmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your\nmurmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.\n\n16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the\nchildren of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your\nmurmurings.\n\n16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation\nof the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,\nand, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.\n\n16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the\nmurmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even\nye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;\nand ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.\n\n16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and\ncovered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.\n\n16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of\nthe wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar\nfrost on the ground.\n\n16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to\nanother, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said\nunto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.\n\n16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it\nevery man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to\nthe number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in\nhis tents.\n\n16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some\nless.\n\n16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much\nhad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they\ngathered every man according to his eating.\n\n16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\n\n16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them\nleft of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses\nwas wroth with them.\n\n16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his\neating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.\n\n16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice\nas much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the\ncongregation came and told Moses.\n\n16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To\nmorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which\nye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which\nremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\n\n16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did\nnot stink, neither was there any worm therein.\n\n16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto\nthe LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.\n\n16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is\nthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n\n16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on\nthe seventh day for to gather, and they found none.\n\n16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my\ncommandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you\nthe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two\ndays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place\non the seventh day.\n\n16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.\n\n16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it\nwas like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers\nmade with honey.\n\n16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,\nFill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see\nthe bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought\nyou forth from the land of Egypt.\n\n16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of\nmanna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your\ngenerations.\n\n16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the\nTestimony, to be kept.\n\n16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they\ncame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the\nborders of the land of Canaan.\n\n16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.\n\n17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from\nthe wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the\ncommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no\nwater for the people to drink.\n\n17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us\nwater that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with\nme? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirsted\nthere for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,\nWherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill\nus and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses cried\nunto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be\nalmost ready to stone me.\n\n17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take\nwith thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest\nthe river, take in thine hand, and go.\n\n17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;\nand thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,\nthat the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders\nof Israel.\n\n17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because\nof the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the\nLORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,\nand fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n\n17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight\nwith Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the\nrod of God in mine hand.\n\n17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:\nand Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n\n17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel\nprevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n\n17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it\nunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,\nthe one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his\nhands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n\n17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of\nthe sword.\n\n17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a\nbook, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put\nout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\n\n17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it\nJehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the\nLORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\n\n18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of\nall that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that\nthe LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses'\nfather in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,\n18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for\nhe said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name of\nthe other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine\nhelp, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,\nMoses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into\nthe wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And he\nsaid unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy\nwife, and her two sons with her.\n\n18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,\nand kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they\ncame into the tent.\n\n18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto\nPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail\nthat had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.\n\n18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done\nto Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n\n18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out\nof the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath\ndelivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n\n18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the\nthing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.\n\n18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and\nsacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to\neat bread with Moses' father in law before God.\n\n18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the\npeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the\nevening.\n\n18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people,\nhe said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest\nthou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto\neven?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people\ncome unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they\ncome unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them\nknow the statutes of God, and his laws.\n\n18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou\ndoest is not good.\n\n18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is\nwith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to\nperform it thyself alone.\n\n18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God\nshall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou\nmayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach them\nordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must\nwalk, and the work that they must do.\n\n18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such\nas fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over\nthem, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of\nfifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people at\nall seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring\nunto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be\neasier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.\n\n18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou\nshalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their\nplace in peace.\n\n18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did\nall that he had said.\n\n18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads\nover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of\nfifties, and rulers of tens.\n\n18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they\nbrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n\n18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into\nhis own land.\n\n19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth\nout of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness\nof Sinai.\n\n19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert\nof Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped\nbefore the mount.\n\n19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of\nthe mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and\ntell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the\nEgyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto\nmyself.\n\n19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my\ncovenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all\npeople: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a\nkingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\n\nThese are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of\nIsrael.\n\n19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid\nbefore their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.\n\n19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD\nhath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people\nunto the LORD.\n\n19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick\ncloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe\nthee for ever.\n\nAnd Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.\n\n19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify\nthem to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 And\nbe ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come\ndown in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.\n\n19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,\nTake heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch\nthe border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to\ndeath: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be\nstoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not\nlive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\n\n19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and\nsanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.\n\n19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:\ncome not at your wives.\n\n19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there\nwere thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and\nthe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that\nwas in the camp trembled.\n\n19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with\nGod; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.\n\n19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD\ndescended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke\nof a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\n\n19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder\nand louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\n\n19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the\nmount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses\nwent up.\n\n19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest\nthey break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.\n\n19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify\nthemselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.\n\n19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount\nSinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and\nsanctify it.\n\n19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt\ncome up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the\npeople break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth\nupon them.\n\n19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.\n\n20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy\nGod, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the\nhouse of bondage.\n\n20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n\n20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness\nof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,\nor that is in the water under the earth.\n\n20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I\nthe LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the\nfathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them\nthat hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love\nme, and keep my commandments.\n\n20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the\nLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n\n20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n\n20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the\nseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not\ndo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor\nthy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy\ngates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,\nand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the\nLORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\n\n20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon\nthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n\n20:13 Thou shalt not kill.\n\n20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n\n20:15 Thou shalt not steal.\n\n20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\n\n20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet\nthy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his\nox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\n\n20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and\nthe noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the\npeople saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.\n\n20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:\nbut let not God speak with us, lest we die.\n\n20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to\nprove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin\nnot.\n\n20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the\nthick darkness where God was.\n\n20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the\nchildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from\nheaven.\n\n20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make\nunto you gods of gold.\n\n20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice\nthereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and\nthine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto\nthee, and I will bless thee.\n\n20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build\nit of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast\npolluted it.\n\n20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy\nnakedness be not discovered thereon.\n\n21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.\n\n21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in\nthe seventh he shall go out free for nothing.\n\n21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were\nmarried, then his wife shall go out with him.\n\n21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons\nor daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he\nshall go out by himself.\n\n21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,\nand my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shall\nbring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or\nunto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an\naul; and he shall serve him for ever.\n\n21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not\ngo out as the menservants do.\n\n21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,\nthen shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation\nhe shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.\n\n21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her\nafter the manner of daughters.\n\n21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty\nof marriage, shall he not diminish.\n\n21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out\nfree without money.\n\n21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to\ndeath.\n\n21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;\nthen I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.\n\n21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him\nwith guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.\n\n21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely\nput to death.\n\n21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found\nin his hand, he shall surely be put to death.\n\n21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be\nput to death.\n\n21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,\nor with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If he\nrise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote\nhim be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall\ncause him to be thoroughly healed.\n\n21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he\ndie under his hand; he shall be surely punished.\n\n21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be\npunished: for he is his money.\n\n21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit\ndepart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely\npunished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he\nshall pay as the judges determine.\n\n21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,\n21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\n21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n\n21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his\nmaid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.\n\n21:27 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's\ntooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.\n\n21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall\nbe surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of\nthe ox shall be quit.\n\n21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and\nit hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but\nthat he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his\nowner also shall be put to death.\n\n21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for\nthe ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.\n\n21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according\nto this judgment shall it be done unto him.\n\n21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall\ngive unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be\nstoned.\n\n21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and\nnot cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 21:34 The owner of the\npit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the\ndead beast shall be his.\n\n21:35 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall\nsell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also\nthey shall divide.\n\n21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,\nand his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and\nthe dead shall be his own.\n\n22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;\nhe shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.\n\n22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,\nthere shall no blood be shed for him.\n\n22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him;\nfor he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall\nbe sold for his theft.\n\n22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be\nox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.\n\n22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall\nput in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best\nof his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make\nrestitution.\n\n22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of\ncorn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he\nthat kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.\n\n22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep,\nand it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let\nhim pay double.\n\n22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be\nbrought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his\nneighbour's goods.\n\n22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for\nsheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another\nchallengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the\njudges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto\nhis neighbour.\n\n22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a\nsheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,\nno man seeing it: 22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them\nboth, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and\nthe owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.\n\n22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the\nowner thereof.\n\n22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and\nhe shall not make good that which was torn.\n\n22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or\ndie, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it\ngood.\n\n22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good:\nif it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.\n\n22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with\nher, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.\n\n22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay\nmoney according to the dowry of virgins.\n\n22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\n\n22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.\n\n22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he\nshall be utterly destroyed.\n\n22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were\nstrangers in the land of Egypt.\n\n22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.\n\n22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I\nwill surely hear their cry; 22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I\nwill kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your\nchildren fatherless.\n\n22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,\nthou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him\nusury.\n\n22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou\nshalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 22:27 For that\nis his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he\nsleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will\nhear;

on the eighth day thou shalt give\nit me.\n\n22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh\nthat is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.\n\n23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the\nwicked to be an unrighteous witness.\n\n23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou\nspeak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 23:3 Neither\nshalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.\n\n23:4 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt\nsurely bring it back to him again.\n\n23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his\nburden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with\nhim.\n\n23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.\n\n23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous\nslay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.\n\n23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and\nperverteth the words of the righteous.\n\n23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of\na stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n\n23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the\nfruits thereof: 23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and\nlie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave\nthe beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with\nthy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.\n\n23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou\nshalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy\nhandmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.\n\n23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and\nmake no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out\nof thy mouth.\n\n23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.\n\n23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat\nunleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time\nappointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and\nnone shall appear before me empty:) 23:16 And the feast of harvest,\nthe firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and\nthe feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou\nhast gathered in thy labours out of the field.\n\n23:17 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the\nLORD God.\n\n23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened\nbread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.\n\n23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\nmother's milk.\n\n23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,\nand to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.\n\n23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will\nnot pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.\n\n23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I\nspeak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary\nunto thine adversaries.\n\n23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the\nAmorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,\nthe Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.\n\n23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do\nafter their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite\nbreak down their images.\n\n23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy\nbread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of\nthee.\n\n23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy\nland: the number of thy days I will fulfil.\n\n23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people\nto whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their\nbacks unto thee.\n\n23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the\nHivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.\n\n23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the\nland become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against\nthee.\n\n23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,\nuntil thou be increased, and inherit the land.\n\n23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of\nthe Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will\ndeliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;

and shalt wave them for\na wave offering before the LORD.\n\n29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon\nthe altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it\nis an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's\nconsecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it\nshall be thy part.\n\n29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the\nshoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved\nup, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,\nand of that which is for his sons: 29:28 And it shall be Aaron's and\nhis sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is\nan heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children\nof Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave\noffering unto the LORD.\n\n29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to\nbe anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.\n\n29:30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven\ndays, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to\nminister in the holy place.\n\n29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his\nflesh in the holy place.\n\n29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the\nbread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was\nmade, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat\nthereof, because they are holy.\n\n29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,\nremain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:\nit shall not be eaten, because it is holy.\n\n29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to\nall things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou\nconsecrate them.\n\n29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for\natonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an\natonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.\n\n29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and\nsanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth\nthe altar shall be holy.\n\n29:38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two\nlambs of the first year day by day continually.\n\n29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb\nthou shalt offer at even: 29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of\nflour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the\nfourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.\n\n29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do\nthereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according\nto the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by\nfire unto the LORD.\n\n29:42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your\ngenerations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before\nthe LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.\n\n29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the\ntabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.\n\n29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the\naltar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me\nin the priest's office.\n\n29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their\nGod.\n\n29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought\nthem forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am\nthe LORD their God.\n\n30:1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim\nwood shalt thou make it.\n\n30:2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth\nthereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height\nthereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.\n\n30:3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and\nthe sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt\nmake unto it a crown of gold round about.\n\n30:4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it,\nby the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make\nit; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.\n\n30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them\nwith gold.\n\n30:6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the\ntestimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I\nwill meet with thee.\n\n30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he\ndresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.\n\n30:8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense\nupon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your\ngenerations.\n\n30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice,\nnor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.\n\n30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a\nyear with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the\nyear shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it\nis most holy unto the LORD.\n\n30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:12 When thou takest\nthe sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they\ngive every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou\nnumberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou\nnumberest them.\n\n30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are\nnumbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel\nis twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.\n\n30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty\nyears old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.\n\n30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less\nthan half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make\nan atonement for your souls.\n\n30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of\nIsrael, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel\nbefore the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.\n\n30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt also\nmake a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and\nthou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the\naltar, and thou shalt put water therein.\n\n30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet\nthereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,\nthey shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near\nto the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:\n30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die\nnot: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to\nhis seed throughout their generations.\n\n30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also\nunto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of\nsweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and\nof sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassia\nfive hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil\nolive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an\nointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy\nanointing oil.\n\n30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation\ntherewith, and the ark of the testimony, 30:27 And the table and all\nhis vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of\nincense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,\nand the laver and his foot.\n\n30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:\nwhatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.\n\n30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,\nthat they may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\n30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This\nshall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.\n\n30:32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make\nany other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it\nshall be holy unto you.\n\n30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of\nit upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.\n\n30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,\nstacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure\nfrankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thou\nshalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,\ntempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it\nvery small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of\nthe congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you\nmost holy.\n\n30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make\nto yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto\nthee holy for the LORD.\n\n30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall\neven be cut off from his people.\n\n31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called by\nname Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:\n31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in\nunderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,\n31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in\nbrass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of\ntimber, to work in all manner of workmanship.\n\n31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of\nAhisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise\nhearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have\ncommanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark\nof the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the\nfurniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, and\nthe pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,\n31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the\nlaver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy\ngarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to\nminister in the priest's office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, and\nsweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have\ncommanded thee shall they do.\n\n31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou also\nunto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:\nfor it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that\nye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.\n\n31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:\nevery one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever\ndoeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his\npeople.\n\n31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of\nrest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,\nhe shall surely be put to death.\n\n31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to\nobserve the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant.\n\n31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for\nin six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he\nrested, and was refreshed.\n\n31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing\nwith him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,\nwritten with the finger of God.\n\n32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of\nthe mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and\nsaid unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for\nthis Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we\nwot not what is become of him.\n\n32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which\nare in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,\nand bring them unto me.\n\n32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in\ntheir ears, and brought them unto Aaron.\n\n32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a\ngraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These\nbe thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\n\n32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron\nmade proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.\n\n32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt\nofferings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat\nand to drink, and rose up to play.\n\n32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,\nwhich thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted\nthemselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I\ncommanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped\nit, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O\nIsrael, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\n\n32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,\nbehold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,\nthat my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:\nand I will make of thee a great nation.\n\n32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth\nthy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth\nout of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?\n32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did\nhe bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them\nfrom the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of\nthis evil against thy people.\n\n32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou\nswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your\nseed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of\nwill I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.\n\n32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto\nhis people.\n\n32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two\ntables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on\nboth their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.\n\n32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the\nwriting of God, graven upon the tables.\n\n32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,\nhe said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.\n\n32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,\nneither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the\nnoise of them that sing do I hear.\n\n32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that\nhe saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he\ncast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.\n\n32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the\nfire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made\nthe children of Israel drink of it.\n\n32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that\nthou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let\nnot the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they\nare set on mischief.\n\n32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:\nfor as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of\nEgypt, we wot not what is become of him.\n\n32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it\noff. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came\nout this calf.\n\n32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had\nmade them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 Then\nMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's\nside? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered\nthemselves together unto him.\n\n32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put\nevery man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate\nthroughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his\ncompanion, and every man his neighbour.\n\n32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and\nthere fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\n\n32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,\neven every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow\nupon you a blessing this day.\n\n32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the\npeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the\nLORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.\n\n32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have\nsinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.\n\n32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,\nI pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.\n\n32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,\nhim will I blot out of my book.\n\n32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have\nspoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:\nnevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.\n\n32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,\nwhich Aaron made.\n\n33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and\nthe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto\nthe land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,\nUnto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel before\nthee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the\nHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a\nland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of\nthee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the\nway.\n\n33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and\nno man did put on him his ornaments.\n\n33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of\nIsrael, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of\nthee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy\nornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.\n\n33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments\nby the mount Horeb.\n\n33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,\nafar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the\ncongregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the\nLORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was\nwithout the camp.\n\n33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,\nthat all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and\nlooked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.\n\n33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the\ncloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and\nthe Lord talked with Moses.\n\n33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle\ndoor: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent\ndoor.\n\n33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh\nunto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant\nJoshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the\ntabernacle.\n\n33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up\nthis people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with\nme. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found\ngrace in my sight.\n\n33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,\nshew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in\nthy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.\n\n33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give\nthee rest.\n\n33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us\nnot up hence.\n\n33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have\nfound grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so\nshall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are\nupon the face of the earth.\n\n33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that\nthou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know\nthee by name.\n\n33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.\n\n33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I\nwill proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious\nto whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew\nmercy.\n\n33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man\nsee me, and live.\n\n33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou\nshalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my\nglory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and\nwill cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will take\naway mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall\nnot be seen.\n\n34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like\nunto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were\nin the first tables, which thou brakest.\n\n34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto\nmount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.\n\n34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen\nthroughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before\nthat mount.\n\n34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses\nrose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the\nLORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.\n\n34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,\nand proclaimed the name of the LORD.\n\n34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The\nLORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in\ngoodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving\niniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear\nthe guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,\nand upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth\ngeneration.\n\n34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and\nworshipped.\n\n34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let\nmy LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and\npardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.\n\n34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I\nwill do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in\nany nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work\nof the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.\n\n34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive\nout before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and\nthe Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n\n34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the\ninhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in\nthe midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break\ntheir images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worship\nno other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:\n34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and\nthey go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,\nand one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou take\nof their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring\nafter their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.\n\n34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\n\n34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou\nshalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the\nmonth Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.\n\n34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among\nthy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.\n\n34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and\nif thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the\nfirstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before\nme empty.\n\n34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt\nrest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n\n34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of\nwheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.\n\n34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the\nLORD God, the God of Israel.\n\n34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy\nborders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up\nto appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.\n\n34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;\nneither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto\nthe morning.\n\n34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\nmother's milk.\n\n34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after\nthe tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with\nIsrael.\n\n34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he\ndid neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables\nthe words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\n\n34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with\nthe two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the\nmount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he\ntalked with him.\n\n34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,\nthe skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.\n\n34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the\ncongregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.\n\n34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave\nthem in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount\nSinai.\n\n34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his\nface.\n\n34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he\ntook the vail off, until he came out.

35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in\nwisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of\nworkmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and\nin silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set\nthem, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.\n\n35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and\nAholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n\n35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of\nwork, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the\nembroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,\nand of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that\ndevise cunning work.\n\n36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in\nwhom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all\nmanner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that\nthe LORD had commanded.\n\n36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted\nman, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose\nheart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And they\nreceived of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had\nbrought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it\nwithal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.\n\n36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,\ncame every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake unto\nMoses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service\nof the work, which the LORD commanded to make.\n\n36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more\nwork for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained\nfrom bringing.\n\n36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make\nit, and too much.\n\n36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of\nthe tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and\npurple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.\n\n36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the\nbreadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.\n\n36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other\nfive curtains he coupled one unto another.\n\n36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the\nselvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of\nanother curtain, in the coupling of the second.\n\n36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in\nthe edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the\nloops held one curtain to another.\n\n36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one\nunto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.\n\n36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the\ntabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.\n\n36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was\nthe breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.\n\n36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by\nthemselves.\n\n36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain\nin the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain\nwhich coupleth the second.\n\n36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,\nthat it might be one.\n\n36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and\na covering of badgers' skins above that.\n\n36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing\nup.\n\n36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board\none cubit and a half.\n\n36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus\ndid he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.\n\n36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle;

that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\n40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15\nAnd thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that\nthey may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing\nshall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their\ngenerations.\n\n40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so\ndid he.\n\n40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on\nthe first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.\n\n40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,\nand set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared\nup his pillars.\n\n40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the\ncovering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the\nstaves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21\nAnd he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the\ncovering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded\nMoses.\n\n40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the\nside of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.\n\n40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the\nLORD had commanded Moses.\n\n40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over\nagainst the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.\n\n40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded\nMoses.\n\n40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation\nbefore the vail: 40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.\n\n40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the\ntabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the\nburnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and\nthe altar, and put water there, to wash withal.\n\n40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their\nfeet thereat: 40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation,\nand when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the\naltar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the\nwork.\n\n40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory\nof the LORD filled the tabernacle.\n\n40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the\ncongregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the\nLORD filled the tabernacle.\n\n40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the\nchildren of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if the\ncloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it\nwas taken up.\n\n40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and\nfire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,\nthroughout all their journeys.\n\n\n\n\nThe Third Book of Moses:  Called Leviticus\n\n\n1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the\ntabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children of\nIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto\nthe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the\nherd, and of the flock.\n\n1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a\nmale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at\nthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.\n\n1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and\nit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.\n\n1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,\nAaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round\nabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.\n\n1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,\nand lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron's\nsons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the\nwood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards\nand his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on\nthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of\nthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without\nblemish.\n\n1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before\nthe LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood\nround about upon the altar.\n\n1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:\nand the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire\nwhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the\nlegs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon\nthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of\nfowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young\npigeons.\n\n1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his\nhead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung\nout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop\nwith his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by\nthe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings\nthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it\nupon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt\nsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n2:1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his\noffering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and\nput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons\nthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour\nthereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;\nand the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an\noffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And the\nremnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a\nthing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\n\n2:4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the\noven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil.\n\n2:5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be\nof fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.\n\n2:6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat\noffering.\n\n2:7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it\nshall be made of fine flour with oil.\n\n2:8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these\nthings unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he\nshall bring it unto the altar.\n\n2:9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial\nthereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by\nfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n2:10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and\nhis sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made\nby fire.\n\n2:11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be\nmade with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any\noffering of the LORD made by fire.\n\n2:12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto\nthe LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.\n\n2:13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with\nsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to\nbe lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt\noffer salt.\n\n2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the\nLORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green\nears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.\n\n2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it\nis a meat offering.\n\n2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten\ncorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense\nthereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n3:1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer\nit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it\nwithout blemish before the LORD.\n\n3:2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill\nit at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons\nthe priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.\n\n3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD;

then let him bring\nfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish\nunto the LORD for a sin offering.\n\n4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of\nthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the\nbullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.\n\n4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,\nand bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priest\nshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven\ntimes before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.\n\n4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the\naltar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of\nthe congregation;

the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that\nis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon\nthem, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the\nkidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from the\nbullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn\nthem upon the altar of the burnt offering.\n\n4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,\nand with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the whole\nbullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,\nwhere the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:\nwhere the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.\n\n4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,\nand the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done\nsomewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things\nwhich should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, which\nthey have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall\noffer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle\nof the congregation.\n\n4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the\nhead of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed\nbefore the LORD.\n\n4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's\nblood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shall\ndip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times\nbefore the LORD, even before the vail.\n\n4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar\nwhich is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the\naltar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of\nthe congregation.\n\n4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the\naltar.\n\n4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a\nsin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an\natonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.\n\n4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn\nhim as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the\ncongregation.\n\n4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance\nagainst any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things\nwhich should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, wherein\nhe hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a\nkid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay his\nhand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they\nkill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.\n\n4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with\nhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,\nand shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt\noffering.\n\n4:26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the\nsacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement\nfor him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n4:27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while\nhe doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD\nconcerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

and the\npriest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made\nby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his\nsin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a\nwitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,\nthen he shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of\nan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of\nunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall\nbe unclean, and guilty.\n\n5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it\nbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he\nknoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.\n\n5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do\ngood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it\nbe hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one\nof these.\n\n5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,\nthat he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And he\nshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he\nhath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,\nfor a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him\nconcerning his sin.\n\n5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his\ntrespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a\nburnt offering.\n\n5:8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that\nwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his\nneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle of\nthe blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar;

he shall put no oil\nupon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a\nsin offering.\n\n5:12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take\nhis handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,\naccording to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin\noffering.\n\n5:13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his\nsin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:\nand the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.\n\n5:14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit a\ntrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;\nthen he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without\nblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.\n\n5:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the\nholy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the\npriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of\nthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are\nforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist\nit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with\nthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance\nwherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against\nthe LORD.\n\n6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, and\ncommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that\nwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken\naway by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have found\nthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in\nany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shall\nbe, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that\nwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully\ngotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing\nwhich he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he\nshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part\nmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day\nof his trespass offering.\n\n6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram\nwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass\noffering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonement\nfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of\nall that he hath done in trespassing therein.\n\n6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and his\nsons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt\noffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the\nmorning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.\n\n6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen\nbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the\nfire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall\nput them beside the altar.\n\n6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and\ncarry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.\n\n6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not\nbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and\nlay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the\nfat of the peace offerings.\n\n6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go\nout.\n\n6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall\noffer it before the LORD, before the altar.\n\n6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat\noffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is\nupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet\nsavour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.\n\n6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with\nunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.\n\n6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for\ntheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the\nsin offering, and as the trespass offering.\n\n6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It\nshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the\nofferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall\nbe holy.\n\n6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering\nof Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the\nday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for\na meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof\nat night.\n\n6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou\nshalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt\nthou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall\noffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly\nburnt.\n\n6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it\nshall not be eaten.\n\n6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and\nto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place\nwhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed\nbefore the LORD: it is most holy.\n\n6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy\nplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when\nthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt\nwash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.\n\n6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and\nif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed\nin water.\n\n6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most\nholy.\n\n6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the\ntabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,\nshall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most\nholy.\n\n7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill\nthe trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round\nabout upon the altar.\n\n7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the\nfat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat\nthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above\nthe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priest\nshall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the\nLORD: it is a trespass offering.\n\n7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten\nin the holy place: it is most holy.\n\n7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one\nlaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have\nit.\n\n7:8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the\npriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he\nhath offered.\n\n7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that\nis dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's\nthat offereth it.\n\n7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the\nsons of Aaron have, one as much as another.\n\n7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he\nshall offer unto the LORD.\n\n7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the\nsacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of\nfine flour, fried.\n\n7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread\nwith the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.\n\n7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an\nheave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that\nsprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.\n\n7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for\nthanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall\nnot leave any of it until the morning.\n\n7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary\noffering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his\nsacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:\n7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day\nshall be burnt with fire.\n\n7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings\nbe eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither\nshall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an\nabomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.\n\n7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;\nit shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean\nshall eat thereof.\n\n7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace\nofferings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon\nhim, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the\nuncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean\nthing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which\npertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his\npeople.\n\n7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or\nof sheep, or of goat.\n\n7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of\nthat which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye\nshall in no wise eat of it.\n\n7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it\nshall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl\nor of beast, in any of your dwellings.\n\n7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that\nsoul shall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his\npeace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD\nof the sacrifice of his peace offerings.\n\n7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\nthe fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be\nwaved for a wave offering before the LORD.\n\n7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast\nshall be Aaron's and his sons'.\n\n7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave\noffering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.\n\n7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace\nofferings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.\n\n7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the\nchildren of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,\nand have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a\nstatute for ever from among the children of Israel.\n\n7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the\nanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\nin the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the\npriest's office; 7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the\nchildren of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for\never throughout their generations.\n\n7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and\nof the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the\nconsecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 Which\nthe LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded\nthe children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the\nwilderness of Sinai.\n\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sons\nwith him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for\nthe sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3\nAnd gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the\ntabernacle of the congregation.\n\n8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was\ngathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the\nLORD commanded to be done.\n\n8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.\n\n8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and\nclothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded\nhim with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him\ntherewith.\n\n8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the\nbreastplate the Urim and the Thummim.\n\n8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon\nhis forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the\nLORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and\nall that was therein, and sanctified them.\n\n8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed\nthe altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to\nsanctify them.\n\n8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and\nanointed him, to sanctify him.\n\n8:13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and\ngirded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and\nhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin\noffering.\n\n8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the\nhorns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the\naltar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified\nit, to make reconciliation upon it.\n\n8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul\nabove the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned\nit upon the altar.\n\n8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt\nwith fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his\nsons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n\n8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar\nround about.\n\n8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the\npieces, and the fat.\n\n8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt\nthe whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet\nsavour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron\nand his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n\n8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it\nupon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right\nhand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.\n\n8:24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the\ntip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and\nupon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood\nupon the altar round about.\n\n8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon\nthe inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and\ntheir fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket of\nunleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened\ncake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the\nfat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron's\nhands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD.\n\n8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the\naltar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet\nsavour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as\nthe LORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was\nupon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,\nand upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and\nsanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'\ngarments with him.\n\n8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the\nbread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,\nAaron and his sons shall eat it.\n\n8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye\nburn with fire.\n\n8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at\nan end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.\n\n8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to\nmake an atonement for you.\n\n8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the\nLORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.\n\n8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by\nthe hand of Moses.\n\n9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and\nhis sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take\nthee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,\nwithout blemish, and offer them before the LORD.\n\n9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye\na kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of\nthe first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also a\nbullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;\nand a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear\nunto you.\n\n9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle\nof the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood\nbefore the LORD.\n\n9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye\nshould do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.\n\n9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin\noffering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,\nand for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an\natonement for them; as the LORD commanded.\n\n9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin\noffering, which was for himself.\n\n9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped\nhis finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and\npoured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, and\nthe kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he\nburnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.\n\n9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.\n\n9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces\nthereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.\n\n9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the\nburnt offering on the altar.\n\n9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which\nwas the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for\nsin, as the first.\n\n9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to\nthe manner.\n\n9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,\nand burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the\nmorning.\n\n9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace\nofferings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 And\nthe fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which\ncovereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:\n9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon\nthe altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for\na wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.\n\n9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,\nand came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt\noffering, and peace offerings.\n\n9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,\nand came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD\nappeared unto all the people.\n\n9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon\nthe altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people\nsaw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.\n\n10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his\ncenser, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered\nstrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.\n\n10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and\nthey died before the LORD.\n\n10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,\nsaying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all\nthe people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.\n\n10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the\nuncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren\nfrom before the sanctuary out of the camp.\n\n10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the\ncamp; as Moses had said.\n\n10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his\nsons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,\nand lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the\nwhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.\n\n10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon\nyou. And they did according to the word of Moses.\n\n10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor\nstrong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the\ntabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for\never throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put difference\nbetween holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And that\nye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD\nhath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.\n\n10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,\nhis sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the\nofferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside\nthe altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy\nplace, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of\nthe LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.\n\n10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean\nplace; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be\nthy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of\npeace offerings of the children of Israel.\n\n10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the\nofferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a\nstatute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.\n\n10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,\nbehold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the\nsons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have ye\nnot eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,\nand God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to\nmake atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood of\nit was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have\neaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.\n\n10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered\ntheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such\nthings have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,\nshould it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And when\nMoses heard that, he was content.\n\n11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,\n11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts\nwhich ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.\n\n11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the\ncud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.\n\n11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or\nof them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the\ncud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,\nyet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n\n11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not\ntouch; they are unclean to you.\n\n11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath\nfins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them\nshall ye eat.\n\n11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the\nrivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which\nis in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 They\nshall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their\nflesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be\nan abomination unto you.\n\n11:13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the\nfowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle,\nand the ossifrage, and the ospray, 11:14 And the vulture, and the kite\nafter his kind; 11:15 Every raven after his kind; 11:16 And the owl,\nand the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 11:17\nAnd the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 11:18 And\nthe swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 11:19 And the stork,\nthe heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\n\n11:20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an\nabomination unto you.\n\n11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth\nupon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon\nthe earth; 11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his\nkind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his\nkind, and the grasshopper after his kind.\n\n11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,\nshall be an abomination unto you.\n\n11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the\ncarcase of them shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash\nhis clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not\nclovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one\nthat toucheth them shall be unclean.\n\n11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts\nthat go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their\ncarcase shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,\nand be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.\n\n11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things\nthat creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise\nafter his kind, 11:30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the\nlizard, and the snail, and the mole.\n\n11:31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth\ntouch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,\nit shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or\nskin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it\nmust be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it\nshall be cleansed.\n\n11:33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,\nwhatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.\n\n11:34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh\nshall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel\nshall be unclean.\n\n11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth\nshall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall\nbe broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.\n\n11:36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of\nwater, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be\nunclean.\n\n11:37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which\nis to be sown, it shall be clean.\n\n11:38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their\ncarcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.\n\n11:39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the\ncarcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,\nand be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it\nshall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n11:41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be\nan abomination; it shall not be eaten.\n\n11:42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all\nfour, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that\ncreep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an\nabomination.\n\n11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing\nthat creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,\nthat ye should be defiled thereby.\n\n11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify\nyourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye\ndefile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon\nthe earth.\n\n11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,\nto be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.\n\n11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every\nliving creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that\ncreepeth upon the earth: 11:47 To make a difference between the\nunclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the\nbeast that may not be eaten.\n\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a\nman child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days\nof the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.\n\n12:3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be\ncircumcised.\n\n12:4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three\nand thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the\nsanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.\n\n12:5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two\nweeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of\nher purifying threescore and six days.\n\n12:6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or\nfor a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt\noffering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,\nunto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:\n12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for\nher; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is\nthe law for her that hath born a male or a female.\n\n12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two\nturtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the\nother for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for\nher, and she shall be clean.\n\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a man\nshall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,\nand it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he\nshall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the\npriests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of\nthe flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the\nplague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague\nof leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him\nunclean.\n\n13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in\nsight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned\nwhite; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven\ndays: 13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,\nbehold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread\nnot in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:\n13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,\nbehold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in\nthe skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and\nhe shall wash his clothes, and be clean.\n\n13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he\nhath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of\nthe priest again.\n\n13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the\nskin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.\n\n13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought\nunto the priest; 13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if\nthe rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,\nand there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 It is an old leprosy\nin the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,\nand shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.\n\n13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy\ncover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to\nhis foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 Then the priest shall\nconsider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he\nshall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned\nwhite: he is clean.\n\n13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.\n\n13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be\nunclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.\n\n13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he\nshall come unto the priest; 13:17 And the priest shall see him: and,\nbehold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall\npronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.\n\n13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,\nand is healed, 13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a white\nrising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be\nshewed to the priest; 13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,\nit be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned\nwhite; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of\nleprosy broken out of the boil.\n\n13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white\nhairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat\ndark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:22 And if it\nspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him\nunclean: it is a plague.\n\n13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is\na burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot\nburning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,\nsomewhat reddish, or white; 13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it:\nand, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be\nin sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the\nburning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the\nplague of leprosy.\n\n13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white\nhair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but\nbe somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27\nAnd the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be\nspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him\nunclean: it is the plague of leprosy.\n\n13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the\nskin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the\npriest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the\nburning.\n\n13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;\n13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in\nsight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair;\nthen the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a\nleprosy upon the head or beard.\n\n13:31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,\nit be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black\nhair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of\nthe scall seven days: 13:32 And in the seventh day the priest shall\nlook on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be\nin it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the\nskin; 13:33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and\nthe priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:\n13:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,\nbehold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper\nthan the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall\nwash his clothes, and be clean.\n\n13:35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;\n13:36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be\nspread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is\nunclean.\n\n13:37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is\nblack hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the\npriest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n13:38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright\nspots, even white bright spots; 13:39 Then the priest shall look: and,\nbehold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish\nwhite; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.\n\n13:40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet\nis he clean.\n\n13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head\ntoward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.\n\n13:42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white\nreddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald\nforehead.\n\n13:43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising\nof the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald\nforehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 13:44 He\nis a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him\nutterly unclean; his plague is in his head.\n\n13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,\nand his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and\nshall cry, Unclean, unclean.\n\n13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be\ndefiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall\nhis habitation be.\n\n13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be\na woollen garment, or a linen garment; 13:48 Whether it be in the\nwarp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any\nthing made of skin; 13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in\nthe garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in\nany thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto\nthe priest: 13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut\nup it that hath the plague seven days: 13:51 And he shall look on the\nplague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment,\neither in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that\nis made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.\n\n13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in\nwoollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for\nit is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n13:53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not\nspread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any\nthing of skin; 13:54 Then the priest shall command that they wash the\nthing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:\n13:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is\nwashed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and\nthe plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the\nfire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.\n\n13:56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark\nafter the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or\nout of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 13:57 And if\nit appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or\nin any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that\nwherein the plague is with fire.\n\n13:58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of\nskin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from\nthem, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.\n\n13:59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen\nor linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to\npronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.\n\n14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 This shall be the law\nof the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the\npriest: 14:3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the\npriest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in\nthe leper; 14:4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is\nto be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet,\nand hyssop: 14:5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be\nkilled in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:6 As for the living\nbird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the\nhyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the\nbird that was killed over the running water: 14:7 And he shall\nsprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,\nand shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose\ninto the open field.\n\n14:8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave\noff all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and\nafter that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of\nhis tent seven days.\n\n14:9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his\nhair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he\nshall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his\nflesh in water, and he shall be clean.\n\n14:10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without\nblemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three\ntenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and\none log of oil.\n\n14:11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that\nis to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation: 14:12 And the priest shall take\none he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of\noil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 14:13 And he\nshall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering\nand the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is\nthe priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 14:14 And\nthe priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and\nthe priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is\nto be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the\ngreat toe of his right foot: 14:15 And the priest shall take some of\nthe log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 14:16\nAnd the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his\nleft hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times\nbefore the LORD: 14:17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand\nshall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\ntoe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 14:18\nAnd the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour\nupon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make\nan atonement for him before the LORD.\n\n14:19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an\natonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and\nafterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 14:20 And the priest shall\noffer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.\n\n14:21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take\none lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for\nhim, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat\noffering, and a log of oil; 14:22 And two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin\noffering, and the other a burnt offering.\n\n14:23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto\nthe priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,\nbefore the LORD.\n\n14:24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and\nthe log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD: 14:25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass\noffering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass\noffering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\ntoe of his right foot: 14:26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into\nthe palm of his own left hand: 14:27 And the priest shall sprinkle\nwith his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven\ntimes before the LORD: 14:28 And the priest shall put of the oil that\nis in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be\ncleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe\nof his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass\noffering: 14:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand\nhe shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an\natonement for him before the LORD.\n\n14:30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young\npigeons, such as he can get; 14:31 Even such as he is able to get, the\none for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the\nmeat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is\nto be cleansed before the LORD.\n\n14:32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose\nhand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.\n\n14:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:34 When\nye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a\npossession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of\nyour possession; 14:35 And he that owneth the house shall come and\ntell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague\nin the house: 14:36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the\nhouse, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that\nis in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go\nin to see the house: 14:37 And he shall look on the plague, and,\nbehold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow\nstrakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;\n14:38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the\nhouse, and shut up the house seven days: 14:39 And the priest shall\ncome again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague\nbe spread in the walls of the house; 14:40 Then the priest shall\ncommand that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and\nthey shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 14:41 And\nhe shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they\nshall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an\nunclean place: 14:42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in\nthe place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall\nplaister the house.\n\n14:43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after\nthat he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the\nhouse, and after it is plaistered; 14:44 Then the priest shall come\nand look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a\nfretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.\n\n14:45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the\ntimber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry\nthem forth out of the city into an unclean place.\n\n14:46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is\nshut up shall be unclean until the even.\n\n14:47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he\nthat eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.\n\n14:48 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold,\nthe plague hath not spread in\n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Brussels number? Don't give information outside the document or repeat your findings. Keep your response short and direct. Answer: ", "outputs": ["9012902"]}, {"input": "[INST] Answer the question based on the given documents. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given documents.\n\nDocument 1:\nOne of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Hervé in the 1050s. By then however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as Trebizond and Georgia. They were based at Malatya and Edessa, under the Byzantine duke of Antioch, Isaac Komnenos. In the 1060s, Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos.\n\nDocument 2:\nDuring Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous. Visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad. President Grover Cleveland attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition in the city on February 22, 1888 during his trip to Florida. This highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism. The city's tourism, however, was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks. In addition, extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further south drew visitors to other areas. From 1893 to 1938 Jacksonville was the site of the Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home with a nearby cemetery.\n\nDocument 3:\nThe unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year.\n\nDocument 4:\nErsatzschulen are ordinary primary or secondary schools, which are run by private individuals, private organizations or religious groups. These schools offer the same types of diplomas as public schools. Ersatzschulen lack the freedom to operate completely outside of government regulation. Teachers at Ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools, an Ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz, also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents (the so-called Sonderungsverbot). Therefore, most Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships, compared to most other Western European countries. However, it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees, which is why all German Ersatzschulen are additionally financed with public funds. The percentages of public money could reach 100% of the personnel expenditures. Nevertheless, Private Schools became insolvent in the past in Germany.\n\nDocument 5:\nJacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, who succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after the latter died on October 29, invited Washington to dine with him. Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country. Saint-Pierre said, \"As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.\" He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.\n\nDocument 6:\nSome elements of the Brotherhood, though perhaps against orders, did engage in violence against the government, and its founder Al-Banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of Egypt's premier Mahmud Fami Naqrashi three months earlier. The Brotherhood has suffered periodic repression in Egypt and has been banned several times, in 1948 and several years later following confrontations with Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser, who jailed thousands of members for several years.\n\nDocument 7:\nThe common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen, O\n2. It is the form that is a major part of the Earth's atmosphere (see Occurrence). O2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kJ·mol−1, which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of O2 with any organic molecule. Due to its energy content, O2 is used by complex forms of life, such as animals, in cellular respiration (see Biological role). Other aspects of O\n2 are covered in the remainder of this article.\n\nDocument 8:\nFederal safety standards, such as NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 (pertaining to safety bumpers), and compacts like the 1974 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT \"downsize\" revision of vehicle categories. By 1977, GM's full-sized cars reflected the crisis. By 1979, virtually all \"full-size\" American cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions. Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year, moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 (except for the M-body Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue sedans).\n\nDocument 9:\nMany known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance P ⊆ NP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE, but it is possible that P = PSPACE. If P is not equal to NP, then P is not equal to PSPACE either. Since there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE, such as RP, BPP, PP, BQP, MA, PH, etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.\n\nDocument 10:\nOn 8 February 2007, BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels. It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport (including English Premier League Football), films, entertainment and news. The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform, and on the same day that NTL's services re-branded as Virgin Media. However, industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels, due to possible lost advertising revenue.\n\nDocument 11:\nWhen Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position, unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E. This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat's Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 33C) at 28.5°E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels. The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom.\n\nDocument 12:\nThe English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\".\n\nDocument 13:\nThe third assessment report (TAR) prominently featured a graph labeled \"Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction\" based on a 1999 paper by Michael E. Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes (MBH99), which has been referred to as the \"hockey stick graph\". This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century. The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007. The MBH99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by Jones et al. 1998, Pollack, Huang & Shen 1998, Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000, using differing data and methods. The Jones et al. and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction in Figure 2.21 of the IPCC report.\n\nDocument 14:\nThe strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles. However, a residual of the force is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called color confinement.\n\nDocument 15:\nThere is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project. New forms include partnering such as Public-Private Partnering (PPPs) aka private finance initiatives (PFIs) and alliances such as \"pure\" or \"project\" alliances and \"impure\" or \"strategic\" alliances. The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.\n\nDocument 16:\nThe conflict is known by multiple names. In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. As there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Other, less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.\n\nDocument 17:\nThe Lobata have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes on either side of the mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.\n\nDocument 18:\nBy 1620 the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure. A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629. revolted against royal authority. The uprising occurred a decade following the death of Henry IV, a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism, who had protected Protestants through the Edict of Nantes. His successor Louis XIII, under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de' Medici, became more intolerant of Protestantism. The Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power. The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French Crown.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 19:\nThe Mongol rulers patronized the Yuan printing industry. Chinese printing technology was transferred to the Mongols through Kingdom of Qocho and Tibetan intermediaries. Some Yuan documents such as Wang Zhen's Nong Shu were printed with earthenware movable type, a technology invented in the 12th century. However, most published works were still produced through traditional block printing techniques. The publication of a Taoist text inscribed with the name of Töregene Khatun, Ögedei's wife, is one of the first printed works sponsored by the Mongols. In 1273, the Mongols created the Imperial Library Directorate, a government-sponsored printing office. The Yuan government established centers for printing throughout China. Local schools and government agencies were funded to support the publishing of books.\n\nDocument 20:\nThe heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (called variously combustion chamber, firebox). In some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor, geothermal energy, solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process. In the case of model or toy steam engines, the heat source can be an electric heating element.\n\nDocument 21:\nThe early United States expressed its opposition to Imperialism, at least in a form distinct from its own Manifest Destiny, through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine. However, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as Theodore Roosevelt’s interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson’s mission to \"make the world safe for democracy\" changed all this. They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes. This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. American foreign policy was denounced as a \"racket\" by Smedley Butler, an American general. He said, \"Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents\".\n\nDocument 22:\nIn the north eastern part of Fresno, Woodward Park was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life. The park's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others. The park is open April through October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm. Woodward Park is home to the annual CIF(California Interscholastic Federation) State Championship cross country meet, which takes place in late November. It is also the home of the Woodward Shakespeare Festival which began performances in the park in 2005.\n\nDocument 23:\nThe descendants of Rollo's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people, blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique \"Norman\" culture in the north of France. The Norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'oïl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the regional language that survives today.\n\nDocument 24:\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.\n\nDocument 25:\nOne of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution. Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments, In South Africa in the fight against apartheid, in the American Civil Rights Movement, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide.\n\nDocument 26:\nIn its focus on the Caliphate, the party takes a different view of Muslim history than some other Islamists such as Muhammad Qutb. HT sees Islam's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of Ali, or one of the other four rightly guided Caliphs in the 7th century, but with the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924. This is believed to have ended the true Islamic system, something for which it blames \"the disbelieving (Kafir) colonial powers\" working through Turkish modernist Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\n\nDocument 27:\nwhere  is the mass of the object,  is the velocity of the object and  is the distance to the center of the circular path and  is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.\n\nDocument 28:\nThe 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) proclaimed an oil embargo. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or \"shock\", with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy. It was later called the \"first oil shock\", followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the \"second oil shock.\"\n\nDocument 29:\nFollowing the Nice Treaty, there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the European Union and make it more transparent; this would have also produced a single constitutional document. However, as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands, the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force. Instead, the Lisbon Treaty was enacted. Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty, but it was formally an amending treaty, and – though it significantly altered the existing treaties – it did not completely replace them.\n\nDocument 30:\nOf course, some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:\n\nDocument 31:\nThe 17th century Royal Ujazdów Castle currently houses Centre for Contemporary Art, with some permanent and temporary exhibitions, concerts, shows and creative workshops. The Centre currently realizes about 500 projects a year. Zachęta National Gallery of Art, the oldest exhibition site in Warsaw, with a tradition stretching back to the mid-19th century organises exhibitions of modern art by Polish and international artists and promotes art in many other ways. Since 2011 Warsaw Gallery Weekend is held on last weekend of September.\n\nDocument 32:\nBraddock (with George Washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne. The expedition was a disaster. It was attacked by French and Indian soldiers ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs. Braddock called for a retreat. He was killed. Approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured. The remaining 500 British troops, led by George Washington, retreated to Virginia. Two future opponents in the American Revolutionary War, Washington and Thomas Gage, played key roles in organizing the retreat.\n\nDocument 33:\nIn the triplet form, O\n2 molecules are paramagnetic. That is, they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O\n2 molecules. Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.[c]\n\nDocument 34:\nThe Tech Coast is a moniker that has gained use as a descriptor for the region's diversified technology and industrial base as well as its multitude of prestigious and world-renowned research universities and other public and private institutions. Amongst these include 5 University of California campuses (Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Barbara, and San Diego); 12 California State University campuses (Bakersfield, Channel Islands, Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Northridge, Pomona, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Marcos, and San Luis Obispo); and private institutions such as the California Institute of Technology, Chapman University, the Claremont Colleges (Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Pitzer College, Pomona College, and Scripps College), Loma Linda University, Loyola Marymount University, Occidental College, Pepperdine University, University of Redlands, University of San Diego, and the University of Southern California.\n\nDocument 35:\nWhen some species, including Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera, are disturbed, they produce secretions (ink) that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies. Juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults, whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies. Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals' environments, such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters.\n\nDocument 36:\nThe Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.\n\nDocument 37:\nConcentrated O\n2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically. Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of O\n2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized. The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O\n2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the 1⁄3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission.[k]\n\nDocument 38:\nThere are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.\n\nDocument 39:\nThe new British command was not in place until July. When he arrived in Albany, Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them. Montcalm took bold action against his inertia. Building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison, Montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.\n\nDocument 40:\nTelenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States. It was founded by former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts as a means of making ARPANET technology public. He had tried to interest AT&T in buying the technology, but the monopoly's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future. Bolt, Beranack and Newman (BBN) provided the financing. It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29. Telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the CCITT. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.\n\nDocument 41:\nFor many native populations, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession. The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes. Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.\n\nDocument 42:\nIn response to American aid to Israel, on October 16, 1973, OPEC raised the posted price of oil by 70%, to $5.11 a barrel. The following day, oil ministers agreed to the embargo, a cut in production by five percent from September's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met. On October 19, Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel, including $1.5 billion in outright grants. George Lenczowski notes, \"Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon's eagerness to prevent Israel's collapse...This [$2.2 billion] decision triggered a collective OPEC response.\" Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on October 20, 1973. At their Kuwait meeting, OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the US as a \"principal hostile country\".\n\nDocument 43:\nPrivate schools are often Anglican, such as King's College and Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland, St Paul's Collegiate School in Hamilton, St Peter's School in Cambridge, Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington, and Christ's College and St Margaret's College in Christchurch; or Presbyterian, such as Saint Kentigern College and St Cuthbert's College in Auckland, Scots College and Queen Margaret College in Wellington, and St Andrew's College and Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Christchurch. Academic Colleges Group is a recent group of private schools run as a business, with schools throughout Auckland, including ACG Senior College in Auckland’s CBD, ACG Parnell College in Parnell, and international school ACG New Zealand International College. There are three private schools (including the secondary school, St Dominic's College) operated by the Catholic schismatic group, the Society of St Pius X in Wanganui.\n\nDocument 44:\nOther prominent alumni include anthropologists David Graeber and Donald Johanson, who is best known for discovering the fossil of a female hominid australopithecine known as \"Lucy\" in the Afar Triangle region, psychologist John B. Watson, American psychologist who established the psychological school of behaviorism, communication theorist Harold Innis, chess grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky, and conservative international relations scholar and White House Coordinator of Security Planning for the National Security Council Samuel P. Huntington.\n\nDocument 45:\nColonel Monckton, in the sole British success that year, captured Fort Beauséjour in June 1755, cutting the French fortress at Louisbourg off from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted, and sometimes committing atrocities. More than any other factor, the cutting off of supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise. The Acadian resistance, in concert with native allies, including the Mi'kmaq, was sometimes quite stiff, with ongoing frontier raids (against Dartmouth and Lunenburg among others). Other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians (ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and Île Saint-Jean), the only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757.\n\nDocument 46:\nThe study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the Y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis, suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site.\n\nDocument 47:\nThe mayor of Warsaw is called President. Generally, in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called presidents – i.e. such cities, which have over 100,000 people or these, where already was president before 1990. The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695–1696). Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw Presidents was simultaneously the Warsaw Voivode. Since 1990 the President of Warsaw had been elected by the City council. In the years of 1994–1999 the mayor of the district Centrum automatically was designated as the President of Warsaw: the mayor of Centrum was elected by the district council of Centrum and the council was elected only by the Centrum residents. Since 2002 the President of Warsaw is elected by all of the citizens of Warsaw.\n\nDocument 48:\nA large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic (mentioned above) would not hold as stated. For example, the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5; if 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified. Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.\n\nDocument 49:\nAfter the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century. In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler). Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime (they are called Fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1). However, the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime. The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1, with p a prime. They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.\n\nDocument 50:\nSince its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.\n\nDocument 51:\nIn 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of Amalfi were joined by Bohemond of Taranto and his nephew Tancred with an army of Italo-Normans. Bohemond was the de facto leader of the Crusade during its passage through Asia Minor. After the successful Siege of Antioch in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city. Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of Jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the Crusader kingdom in Transjordan and the region of Galilee.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 52:\nBritish researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods (life expectancy by country, educational performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued) in countries and states with higher inequality. Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality, than in countries (US and UK) and states (Mississippi and New York) with large differences in household income.\n\nDocument 53:\nThe interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only \"always oppose\" infidels \"in every way,\" but \"hate them for their religion ... for Allah's sake,\" that democracy \"is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century,\" that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels, etc. While this effort has by no means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the \"gold standard\" of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.\n\nDocument 54:\nEnvironmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming. Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems—of the order of 1.1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon. Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62 ± 0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996.\n\nDocument 55:\nThe following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types. Some of these primes have been found using distributed computing. In 2009, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively. Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form (that is, no simple formula such as that of Mersenne primes) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data, converting it to a number n, multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k, and searching for possible primes within the interval [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) − 1].[citation needed]\n\nDocument 56:\nAround 1800 Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans in 1801 introduced engines using high-pressure steam; Trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802. These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications. Thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.\n\nDocument 57:\nIn Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422. The oldest is claimed to have been set up in 1221 in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy, which now houses a perfume museum. The medieval Esteve Pharmacy, located in Llívia, a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerdà, also now a museum, dates back to the 15th century, keeping albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs.\n\nDocument 58:\nNear Tamins-Reichenau the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine join and form the Rhine. The river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur. This section is nearly 86 km long, and descends from a height of 599 m to 396 m. It flows through a wide glacial alpine valley known as the Rhine Valley (German: Rheintal). Near Sargans a natural dam, only a few metres high, prevents it from flowing into the open Seeztal valley and then through Lake Walen and Lake Zurich into the river Aare. The Alpine Rhine begins in the most western part of the Swiss canton of Graubünden, and later forms the border between Switzerland to the West and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the East.\n\nDocument 59:\nOxygen gas (O\n2) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures, leading to convulsions and other health problems.[j] Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals (kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level O\n2 partial pressure of about 21 kPa. This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%–50% O\n2 by volume (about 30 kPa at standard pressure). (although this figure also is subject to wide variation, depending on type of mask).\n\nDocument 60:\nIn 1939, c. 1,300,000 people lived in Warsaw, but in 1945 – only 420,000. During the first years after the war, the population growth was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses. The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital. Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore.\n\nDocument 61:\nThe simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction. Most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually \"shortening the cutoff\" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression (\"kick back\").[citation needed]\n\nDocument 62:\nThe immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.\n\nDocument 63:\nSome Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire, one of the main centres of the British lace industry at the time. Although 19th century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry, this is contentious. The only reference to immigrant lacemakers in this period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover, and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire. The implication that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a \"combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground\", is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe.\n\nDocument 64:\nFor a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.\n\nDocument 65:\nPlotting the relationship between level of income and inequality, Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve. Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s. This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory.[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.\n\nDocument 66:\nMortgage bankers, accountants, and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project. The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project. Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process. Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation. Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid.\n\nDocument 67:\nIn addition to the General Assembly Hall, the Parliament also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council. The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices. Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished. The former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council) housed the Parliament's visitors' centre and shop, whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament's principal committee room.\n\nDocument 68:\nThe right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency. It is also not possible to abolish these rights. This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future. Still, they are less common than in many other countries. Overall, between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1% to 7.8% (including rise from 0.5% to 6.1% in the former GDR). Percent of students in private high schools reached 11.1%.\n\nDocument 69:\nOne of the most famous people born in Warsaw was Maria Skłodowska-Curie, who achieved international recognition for her research on radioactivity and was the first female recipient of the Nobel Prize. Famous musicians include Władysław Szpilman and Frédéric Chopin. Though Chopin was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, about 60 km (37 mi) from Warsaw, he moved to the city with his family when he was seven months old. Casimir Pulaski, a Polish general and hero of the American Revolutionary War, was born here in 1745.\n\nDocument 70:\nWhile acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth. The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality. For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction. In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon: \"While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.\"\n\nDocument 71:\nA static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances. For example, an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the \"spring reaction force\", which equals the object's weight. Using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); Archimedes' principle for buoyancy; Archimedes' analysis of the lever; Boyle's law for gas pressure; and Hooke's law for springs. These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his Three Laws of Motion.\n\nDocument 72:\nBaran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into survivable communications networks, first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265, later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964. Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network. The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.\n\nDocument 73:\nThis combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic ground state. An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen (see the filled π* orbitals in the diagram), orbitals that are of equal energy—i.e., degenerate—is a configuration termed a spin triplet state. Hence, the ground state of the O\n2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.[b] The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.\n\nDocument 74:\nMany important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\nDocument 75:\nAt the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called \"Right Alan Guard\" which was combined with \"recently surrendered\" soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih). After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them. The Mongol appointed Governor of Samarqand was a Qara-Khitay (Khitan), held the title Taishi, familiar with Chinese culture his name was Ahai\n\nDocument 76:\nThe zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then ζ(1) would have a finite value. However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes. Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (Basel problem), due to Euler,\n\nDocument 77:\nSeismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.\n\nDocument 78:\nOveractive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction, particularly the autoimmune disorders. Here, the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self, and attacks part of the body. Under normal circumstances, many T cells and antibodies react with \"self\" peptides. One of the functions of specialized cells (located in the thymus and bone marrow) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens, preventing autoimmunity.\n\nDocument 79:\nSome modern scholars, such as Fielding H. Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.\n\nDocument 80:\nHomes from the early 20th century line this boulevard in the heart of the historic Alta Vista Tract. The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.\n\nDocument 81:\nHelper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.\n\nDocument 82:\nAlthough it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have \"direct effect\". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \"Regulations,\" held the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have the effect of \"jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.\" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.\n\nDocument 83:\nAs interesting examples of expositions the most notable are: the world's first Museum of Posters boasting one of the largest collections of art posters in the world, Museum of Hunting and Riding and the Railway Museum. From among Warsaw's 60 museums, the most prestigious ones are National Museum with a collection of works whose origin ranges in time from antiquity till the present epoch as well as one of the best collections of paintings in the country including some paintings from Adolf Hitler's private collection, and Museum of the Polish Army whose set portrays the history of arms.\n\nDocument 84:\nResearch by Harvard economist Robert Barro, found that there is \"little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment\". According to work by Barro in 1999 and 2000, high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries. A study of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less, but no correlation after ten years. Studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time, and a negative impact on the duration of growth.\n\nDocument 85:\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, Fécamp, Jumièges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"Winchester school\", which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\n\nDocument 86:\nThere were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty, such as Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China. However, unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam. Instead, Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions. A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language.\n\nDocument 87:\nAnalogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity, circuit complexity, and decision tree complexity.\n\nDocument 88:\nImmediately after Decision Time a \"Members Debate\" is held, which lasts for 45 minutes. Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a Scottish minister. Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time. As well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate. The relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to \"winds up\" the debate by speaking after all other participants.\n\nDocument 89:\nThrough stream capture, the Rhine extended its watershed southward. By the Pliocene period, the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains, including the Mosel, the Main and the Neckar. The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone. By the early Pleistocene period, the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rhône, including the Aar. Since that time, the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance (Vorderrhein, Hinterrhein, Alpenrhein; captured from the Rhône), the upper reaches of the Main, beyond Schweinfurt and the Vosges Mountains, captured from the Meuse, to its watershed.\n\nDocument 90:\nTo measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices?\n\nDocument 91:\nSome have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism. This internal form is distinct from informal U.S. imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony. This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States' formation of \"colonies\" abroad. Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been referred to as \"internal colonialism\". Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America's \"internal colonialism\". However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans. In his lecture on April 16, 2003, Edward Said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the United States, whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary Orient, \"due to their backward living, lack of democracy and the violation of women’s rights. The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon\".\n\nDocument 92:\nThe biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer (62 acres) of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species. A study in 1999 found one square kilometer (247 acres) of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants. The average plant biomass is estimated at 356 ± 47 tonnes per hectare. To date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued. The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000.\n\nDocument 93:\nEconomist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand. Economist Branko Milanovic, wrote in 2001 that, \"The view that income inequality harms growth – or that improved equality can help sustain growth – has become more widely held in recent years. ... The main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development. When physical capital mattered most, savings and investments were key. Then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital. But now that human capital is scarcer than machines, widespread education has become the secret to growth.\"\n\nDocument 94:\nIn 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of the General Sejm, permanent from 1569. In 1573 the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation, formally establishing religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to its central location between the Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596. In the following years the town expanded towards the suburbs. Several private independent districts were established, the property of aristocrats and the gentry, which were ruled by their own laws. Three times between 1655–1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces.\n\nDocument 95:\nIn 2001, 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change. The joint statement was made by the Australian Academy of Science, the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of Canada, the Caribbean Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina, the Indian National Science Academy, the Indonesian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Irish Academy, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (Italy), the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, the Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society (UK). The statement, also published as an editorial in the journal Science, stated \"we support the [TAR's] conclusion that it is at least 90% certain that temperatures will continue to rise, with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 °C above 1990 levels by 2100\". The TAR has also been endorsed by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, and European Geosciences Union (refer to \"Endorsements of the IPCC\").\n\nDocument 96:\nEvery May since 1987, the University of Chicago has held the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, in which large teams of students compete to obtain notoriously esoteric items from a list. Since 1963, the Festival of the Arts (FOTA) takes over campus for 7–10 days of exhibitions and interactive artistic endeavors. Every January, the university holds a week-long winter festival, Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko, which include early morning exercise routines and fitness workshops. The university also annually holds a summer carnival and concert called Summer Breeze that hosts outside musicians, and is home to Doc Films, a student film society founded in 1932 that screens films nightly at the university. Since 1946, the university has organized the Latke-Hamantash Debate, which involves humorous discussions about the relative merits and meanings of latkes and hamantashen.\n\nDocument 97:\nVictoria is the centre of dairy farming in Australia. It is home to 60% of Australia's 3 million dairy cattle and produces nearly two-thirds of the nation's milk, almost 6.4 billion litres. The state also has 2.4 million beef cattle, with more than 2.2 million cattle and calves slaughtered each year. In 2003–04, Victorian commercial fishing crews and aquaculture industry produced 11,634 tonnes of seafood valued at nearly A$109 million. Blacklipped abalone is the mainstay of the catch, bringing in A$46 million, followed by southern rock lobster worth A$13.7 million. Most abalone and rock lobster is exported to Asia.\n\nDocument 98:\nSince then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as \"gravitational force\".\n\nDocument 99:\nIn 1846, the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' \"participation in the Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"intellectual existences\". Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \"official philosophy\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.\n\nDocument 100:\nA study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"\n\nDocument 101:\nFollowing the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \"distributive efficiency\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.\n\nDocument 102:\nJacksonville, like most large cities in the United States, suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after World War II. The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs. After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride. However, the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class \"white flight\" left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before. The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, declined from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.\n\nDocument 103:\nBuilding activity occurred in numerous noble palaces and churches during the later decades of the 17th century. One of the best examples of this architecture are Krasiński Palace (1677–1683), Wilanów Palace (1677–1696) and St. Kazimierz Church (1688–1692). The most impressive examples of rococo architecture are Czapski Palace (1712–1721), Palace of the Four Winds (1730s) and Visitationist Church (façade 1728–1761). The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period. Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the Palace on the Water (rebuilt 1775–1795), Królikarnia (1782–1786), Carmelite Church (façade 1761–1783) and Evangelical Holy Trinity Church (1777–1782). The economic growth during the first years of Congress Poland caused a rapid rise architecture. The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture, the most notable are the Great Theater (1825–1833) and buildings located at Bank Square (1825–1828).\n\nDocument 104:\nWhen finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward. He appointed Robert of Jumièges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.\n\nDocument 105:\nThe first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and, on 21 February 1804, the world's first railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales. The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives.\n\nDocument 106:\nAs indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide, such as in the Peruvian Amazon indigenous peoples' rainforest communities continue to disappear, while others, like the Urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories. Meanwhile, the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland South American peoples has gained increased attention, as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts.\n\nDocument 107:\nBritain's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century. In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year. With the establishment of trading posts in India, the British were able to maintain strength relative to others empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India. In 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy.\n\nDocument 108:\nIn the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was seafloor spreading, showed that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.\n\nDocument 109:\nIn Sweden, pupils are free to choose a private school and the private school gets paid the same amount as municipal schools. Over 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled in private schools in 2008. Sweden is internationally known for this innovative school voucher model that provides Swedish pupils with the opportunity to choose the school they prefer. For instance, the biggest school chain, Kunskapsskolan (“The Knowledge School”), offers 30 schools and a web-based environment, has 700 employees and teaches nearly 10,000 pupils. The Swedish system has been recommended to Barack Obama.\n\nDocument 110:\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of the State House in downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university, academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall, Memorial Church, and the majority of the freshman dormitories. Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses, nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River. The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall and library. The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness.\n\nDocument 111:\nThe steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam. The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Watt independently discovered latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature. The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.\n\nDocument 112:\nTo help reduce consumption, in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph (about 88 km/h) was imposed through the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act. Development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began in 1975, and in 1977 the cabinet-level Department of Energy was created, followed by the National Energy Act of 1978.[citation needed] On November 28, 1995, Bill Clinton signed the National Highway Designation Act, ending the federal 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limit, allowing states to restore their prior maximum speed limit.\n\nDocument 113:\nBetween 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the Norman noble Jean de Bethencourt and the Poitevine Gadifer de la Salle conquered the Canarian islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and El Hierro off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Their troops were gathered in Normandy, Gascony and were later reinforced by Castilian colonists.\n\nDocument 114:\nThe primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties, the \"core\" treaties being the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states. The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law. Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply.[vague] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives. The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law. Individuals may rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional.\n\nDocument 115:\nWhen considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.\n\nDocument 116:\nThe further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded Dyrrachium, owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium—one of the most important naval bases of the Adriatic—fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\nDocument 117:\nIt was shown by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.\n\nDocument 118:\nThe availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France. The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the Protestant Reformation finally arrived. Around 1294, a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest, Guyard de Moulin. A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by Jean de Rély, was printed in Paris in 1487.\n\nDocument 119:\nEffects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems, and lower rates of social goods, a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption, and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption. For the top 21 industrialised countries, counting each person equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = -.907). A similar relationship exists among US states (r = -.620).\n\nDocument 120:\nA further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.\n\nDocument 121:\nA method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders.\n\nDocument 122:\nThe physicians of the Yuan court came from diverse cultures. Healers were divided into non-Mongol physicians called otachi and traditional Mongol shamans. The Mongols characterized otachi doctors by their use of herbal remedies, which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of Mongol shamanism. Physicians received official support from the Yuan government and were given special legal privileges. Kublai created the Imperial Academy of Medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors. Confucian scholars were attracted to the medical profession because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with Confucian virtues.\n\nDocument 123:\nWhen rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.\n\nDocument 124:\nImmunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.\n\nDocument 125:\nThroughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city. According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants. Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.\n\nDocument 126:\nFor a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance. However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\n\nDocument 127:\nThe concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples. It was believed that a certain person's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination. For example, people living in tropical environments were seen as \"less civilized\" therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission. Across the three waves of European colonialism (first in the Americas, second in Asia and lastly in Africa), environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. This takes two forms, orientalism and tropicality.\n\nDocument 128:\nIn July 2013, the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft’s use of the term \"SkyDrive\" infringed on Sky’s right to the \"Sky\" trademark. On 31 July 2013, BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement, in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling, and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified \"reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand,\" plus \"financial and other terms, the details of which are confidential\". On 27 January 2014, Microsoft announced \"that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive\" and \"SkyDrive Pro\" becomes \"OneDrive for Business\".\n\nDocument 129:\nThis shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy.\"\n\nDocument 130:\nMontpellier was among the most important of the 66 \"villes de sûreté\" that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots. The city's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots. Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622. Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city's fortifications. A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party. Even before the Edict of Alès (1629), Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 131:\nThe adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is \"remembered\" by a signature antigen. The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific \"non-self\" antigens during a process called antigen presentation. Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by \"memory cells\". Should a pathogen infect the body more than once, these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it.\n\nDocument 132:\nIn 1973, Nixon named William E. Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo. Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972, which worked for states whose populations were not increasing. In other states, lines at gasoline stations were common. The American Automobile Association reported that in the last week of February 1974, 20% of American gasoline stations had no fuel.\n\nDocument 133:\nThe University of Chicago Library system encompasses six libraries that contain a total of 9.8 million volumes, the 11th most among library systems in the United States. The university's main library is the Regenstein Library, which contains one of the largest collections of print volumes in the United States. The Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, built in 2011, houses a large study space and an automatic book storage and retrieval system. The John Crerar Library contains more than 1.3 million volumes in the biological, medical and physical sciences and collections in general science and the philosophy and history of science, medicine, and technology. The university also operates a number of special libraries, including the D'Angelo Law Library, the Social Service Administration Library, and the Eckhart Library for mathematics and computer science, which closed temporarily for renovation on July 8, 2013. Harper Memorial Library no longer contains any volumes; however it is, in addition to the Regenstein Library, a 24-hour study space on campus.\n\nDocument 134:\nJohn Dalton's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.[a]\n\nDocument 135:\nIn addition to identifying rocks in the field, petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals. Stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units.\n\nDocument 136:\nHarbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port. Its riverine location facilitates two United States Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville, Florida's third largest seaport. The two US Navy bases, Blount Island Command and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay form the third largest military presence in the United States. Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking, insurance, healthcare and logistics. As with much of Florida, tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area, particularly tourism related to golf. People from Jacksonville may be called \"Jacksonvillians\" or \"Jaxsons\" (also spelled \"Jaxons\").\n\nDocument 137:\nIn 2004, declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973. Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that \"it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force.\" British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions, which concluded America \"might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries,\" and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon. Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned \"the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the ‘total alienation’ of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World.\"\n\nDocument 138:\nLos Angeles (at 3.7 million people) and San Diego (at 1.3 million people), both in southern California, are the two largest cities in all of California (and two of the eight largest cities in the United States). In southern California there are also twelve cities with more than 200,000 residents and 34 cities over 100,000 in population. Many of southern California's most developed cities lie along or in close proximity to the coast, with the exception of San Bernardino and Riverside.\n\nDocument 139:\nBut bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2). This forms the basis for the complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is FP.\n\nDocument 140:\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world. As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.\n\nDocument 141:\nMost of the Rhine's current course was not under the ice during the last Ice Age; although, its source must still have been a glacier. A tundra, with Ice Age flora and fauna, stretched across middle Europe, from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean. Such was the case during the Last Glacial Maximum, ca. 22,000–14,000 yr BP, when ice-sheets covered Scandinavia, the Baltics, Scotland and the Alps, but left the space between as open tundra. The loess or wind-blown dust over that tundra, settled in and around the Rhine Valley, contributing to its current agricultural usefulness.\n\nDocument 142:\nCurrent faculty include the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, historian Dipesh Chakrabarty, paleontologists Neil Shubin and Paul Sereno, evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne, Nobel prize winning physicist Yoichiro Nambu, Nobel prize winning physicist James Cronin, Nobel Prize winning economists Eugene Fama, James Heckman, Lars Peter Hansen, Roger Myerson and Robert Lucas, Jr., Freakonomics author and noted economist Steven Levitt, current governor of India's central bank Raghuram Rajan, the 74th United States Secretary of the Treasury and former Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Hank Paulson, former Chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisors Austan Goolsbee, Shakespeare scholar David Bevington, and renowned political scientists John Mearsheimer and Robert Pape.\n\nDocument 143:\nThe legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the First Crusade carved out a Norman principality in Antioch. They were major foreign participants in the Reconquista in Iberia. In 1018, Roger de Tosny travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from Moorish lands, but failed. In 1064, during the War of Barbastro, William of Montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty.\n\nDocument 144:\nA third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture.\n\nDocument 145:\nFollowing the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \"popery\"; the Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.\n\nDocument 146:\nSubsequently, Californios (dissatisfied with inequitable taxes and land laws) and pro-slavery southerners in the lightly populated \"Cow Counties\" of southern California attempted three times in the 1850s to achieve a separate statehood or territorial status separate from Northern California. The last attempt, the Pico Act of 1859, was passed by the California State Legislature and signed by the State governor John B. Weller. It was approved overwhelmingly by nearly 75% of voters in the proposed Territory of Colorado. This territory was to include all the counties up to the then much larger Tulare County (that included what is now Kings, most of Kern, and part of Inyo counties) and San Luis Obispo County. The proposal was sent to Washington, D.C. with a strong advocate in Senator Milton Latham. However, the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote.\n\nDocument 147:\nOn May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire. Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabling the fire to spread rapidly. In just eight hours, it swept through 146 city blocks, destroyed over 2,000 buildings, left about 10,000 homeless and killed 7 residents. The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire. Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order. On May 17 municipal authority resumed in Jacksonville. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh, North Carolina. Known as the \"Great Fire of 1901\", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902. The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning achievement.\n\nDocument 148:\nThe mermaid (syrenka) is Warsaw's symbol and can be found on statues throughout the city and on the city's coat of arms. This imagery has been in use since at least the mid-14th century. The oldest existing armed seal of Warsaw is from the year 1390, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription Sigilium Civitatis Varsoviensis (Seal of the city of Warsaw). City records as far back as 1609 document the use of a crude form of a sea monster with a female upper body and holding a sword in its claws. In 1653 the poet Zygmunt Laukowski asks the question:\n\nDocument 149:\nThe university operates 12 research institutes and 113 research centers on campus. Among these are the Oriental Institute—a museum and research center for Near Eastern studies owned and operated by the university—and a number of National Resource Centers, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Chicago also operates or is affiliated with a number of research institutions apart from the university proper. The university partially manages Argonne National Laboratory, part of the United States Department of Energy's national laboratory system, and has a joint stake in Fermilab, a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico. Faculty and students at the adjacent Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago collaborate with the university, In 2013, the university announced that it was affiliating the formerly independent Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. Although formally unrelated, the National Opinion Research Center is located on Chicago's campus.\n\nDocument 150:\nEven before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point, where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small stockaded fort. Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrecœur to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period, and Contrecœur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5, 1754. When these forces arrived at the fort on April 16, Contrecœur generously allowed Trent's small company to withdraw. He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne.\n\nDocument 151:\nWhen suffering from sleep deprivation, active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.\n\nDocument 152:\n2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem. Increasing inequality harms economic growth. High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth.\n\nDocument 153:\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. From that time up until the Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs, once in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou. During the Yuan dynasty, the Emperor Kublai Khan invited the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu to return to Qufu. Kong Zhu refused, and gave up the title, so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng. The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day. Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000. During the Yuan dynasty, one of Confucius' descendants moved from China to Goryeo era Korea and established a branch of the family there after marrying a Korean woman.\n\nDocument 154:\nA computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g. 15) and the solution is \"yes\" if the number is prime and \"no\" otherwise (in this case \"no\"). Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.\n\nDocument 155:\nIt has been argued that the term \"civil disobedience\" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, \"It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official. Indeed, for Vice President Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins.\"\n\nDocument 156:\nThe Yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China. In the historiography of Mongolia, it is generally considered to be the continuation of the Mongol Empire. Mongols are widely known to worship the Eternal Heaven, and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan is considered to be \"the beginning of an infinite number of beings, the foundation of peace and happiness, state power, the dream of many peoples, besides it there is nothing great or precious.\" In traditional historiography of China, on the other hand, the Yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the Song dynasty and the Ming dynasty. Note, however, Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271, partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu (Chinese: 太祖). Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views (including the government of the Ming dynasty which overthrew the Yuan dynasty), there also exist Chinese people[who?] who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China, but rather as a period of foreign domination. The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens,[citation needed] and that China stagnated economically and scientifically.\n\nDocument 157:\nDue to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by El Temür, Tugh Temür is known for his cultural contribution instead. He adopted many measures honoring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values. His most concrete effort to patronize Chinese learning was founding the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature (Chinese: 奎章閣學士院), first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake \"a number of tasks relating to the transmission of Confucian high culture to the Mongolian imperial establishment\". The academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books, but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named Jingshi Dadian (Chinese: 經世大典). Tugh Temür supported Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism and also devoted himself in Buddhism.\n\nDocument 158:\nIn July 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq overthrew Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's regime in Pakistan. Ali Bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown. Zia-ul-Haq was much more committed to Islamism, and \"Islamization\" or implementation of Islamic law, became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and Islamism became his \"official state ideology\". Zia ul Haq was an admirer of Mawdudi and Mawdudi's party Jamaat-e-Islami became the \"regime's ideological and political arm\". In Pakistan this Islamization from above was \"probably\" more complete \"than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan,\" but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing \"symbols\" rather than substance, and using Islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power. Unlike neighboring Iran, Zia-ul-Haq's policies were intended to \"avoid revolutionary excess\", and not to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies. Zia-ul-Haq was killed in 1988 but Islamization remains an important element in Pakistani society.\n\nDocument 159:\nAfter the death of Tugh Temür in 1332 and subsequent death of Rinchinbal (Emperor Ningzong) the same year, the 13-year-old Toghun Temür (Emperor Huizong), the last of the nine successors of Kublai Khan, was summoned back from Guangxi and succeeded to the throne. After El Temür's death, Bayan became as powerful an official as El Temür had been in the beginning of his long reign. As Toghun Temür grew, he came to disapprove of Bayan's autocratic rule. In 1340 he allied himself with Bayan's nephew Toqto'a, who was in discord with Bayan, and banished Bayan by coup. With the dismissal of Bayan, Toghtogha seized the power of the court. His first administration clearly exhibited fresh new spirit. He also gave a few early signs of a new and positive direction in central government. One of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties, which were eventually completed in 1345. Yet, Toghtogha resigned his office with the approval of Toghun Temür, marking the end of his first administration, and he was not called back until 1349.\n\nDocument 160:\nIn 1900, the Los Angeles Times defined southern California as including \"the seven counties of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura and Santa Barbara.\" In 1999, the Times added a newer county—Imperial—to that list.\n\nDocument 161:\nThe Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.\n\nDocument 162:\nBSkyB's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2, with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard. Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including modems for a return path. Sky News, amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.\n\nDocument 163:\nA variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.\n\nDocument 164:\nPolitically, the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong \"colonial\" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of \"barbarians\" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: \"... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only \"Mongols and Tartars\" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them\".\n\nDocument 165:\nIn 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire, from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas stated that \"Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union\". With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste, Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for \"ecological crimes\". The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission. That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law – something never done before. So far, the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive. Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence, but was rejected at vote. However, in October 2007, the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be, only that there must be some.\n\nDocument 166:\nTension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.\n\nDocument 167:\nGothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications. The most significant buildings are St. John's Cathedral (14th century), the temple is a typical example of the so-called Masovian gothic style, St. Mary's Church (1411), a town house of Burbach family (14th century), Gunpowder Tower (after 1379) and the Royal Castle Curia Maior (1407–1410). The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of Baryczko merchant family (1562), building called \"The Negro\" (early 17th century) and Salwator tenement (1632). The most interesting examples of mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle (1596–1619) and the Jesuit Church (1609–1626) at Old Town. Among the first structures of the early baroque the most important are St. Hyacinth's Church (1603–1639) and Sigismund's Column (1644).\n\nDocument 168:\nThe Rhine is the longest river in Germany. It is here that the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries, such as the Neckar, the Main and, later, the Moselle, which contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3/s (11,000 cu ft/s). Northeastern France drains to the Rhine via the Moselle; smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands. Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine via the Moselle. As it approaches the Dutch border, the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of 2,290 m3/s (81,000 cu ft/s) and an average width of 400 m (1,300 ft).\n\nDocument 169:\nMost early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime. Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime. By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a \"unit\".\n\nDocument 170:\nSeveral project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including design-build, partnering and construction management. In general, each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects, interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and construction. In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process.\n\nDocument 171:\nSpain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War, and the British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.\n\nDocument 172:\nA controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds. J. A. Hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as: \"It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by the races of highest 'social efficiency'\". Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of \"Social Darwinism\" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism. The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose, for example throughout Latin America \"whiteness\" is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento (whitening) are common.\n\nDocument 173:\nThe French acquired a copy of the British war plans, including the activities of Shirley and Johnson. Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by Shirley's inexperience in managing large expeditions. In conjunction, Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara. As a response, Shirley left garrisons at Oswego, Fort Bull, and Fort Williams (the latter two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at present-day Rome, New York). Supplies for use in the projected attack on Niagara were cached at Fort Bull.\n\nDocument 174:\nSayyid Abul Ala Maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the Islamic revival in India, and then after independence from Britain, in Pakistan. Trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about Islam and Islamic law. Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972. However, Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising. His extremely influential books (translated into many languages) placed Islam in a modern context, and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer Islamists such as al-Faruqi, whose \"Islamization of Knowledge\" carried forward some of Maududi's key principles.\n\nDocument 175:\nJohnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil. He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).\n\nDocument 176:\nPrice controls exacerbated the crisis in the US. The system limited the price of \"old oil\" (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity. The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies. The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration. Scarcity was addressed by rationing (as in many countries). Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973.\n\nDocument 177:\nJacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities, although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane. The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area. The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area. These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished. The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed. Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process. On May 28, 2012, Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl, packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach.\n\nDocument 178:\nThe University of Chicago was created and incorporated as a coeducational, secular institution in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field. While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus' first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons), Martin A. Ryerson (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.\n\nDocument 179:\nCharles W. Eliot, president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson, these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.\n\nDocument 180:\nHowever, already in quantum mechanics there is one \"caveat\", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the \"spin\", and there is the Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons. If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g. parallel spins) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.\n\nDocument 181:\nFormed in 1946, Sierra Sky Park Airport is a residential airport community born of a unique agreement in transportation law to allow personal aircraft and automobiles to share certain roads. Sierra Sky Park was the first aviation community to be built[citation needed] and there are now numerous such communities across the United States and around the world. Developer William Smilie created the nation's first planned aviation community. Still in operation today, the public use airport provides a unique neighborhood that spawned interest and similar communities nationwide.\n\nDocument 182:\nThe principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 (now: TFEU). Minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s. Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single, internal market in the Single European Act 1986, to further the development of a more social Europe in the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the EU institutions in the Treaty of Nice 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon 2007. Since its establishment, more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties, from the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway in 1972 (though Norway did not end up joining), Greece in 1979, Spain and Portugal 1985, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1994 (though again Norway failed to join, because of lack of support in the referendum), the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004, Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and Croatia in 2013. Greenland signed a Treaty in 1985 giving it a special status.\n\nDocument 183:\nSubject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session, and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament. Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government. The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education and Culture; Health and Sport; Justice; Local Government and Regeneration; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment.\n\nDocument 184:\nBritish victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759, when they finally captured Ticonderoga, James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec (in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders), and victory at Fort Niagara successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south. The victory was made complete in 1760 when, despite losing outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte-Foy, the British were able to prevent the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides.\n\nDocument 185:\nPrior to European settlement, the area now constituting Victoria was inhabited by a large number of Aboriginal peoples, collectively known as the Koori. With Great Britain having claimed the entire Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east in 1788, Victoria was included in the wider colony of New South Wales. The first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay, and much of what is now Victoria was included in the Port Phillip District in 1836, an administrative division of New South Wales. Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved self-government in 1855. The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the Federation of Australia in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia. Melbourne also served as capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927, with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne.\n\nDocument 186:\nA B cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.\n\nDocument 187:\nCéloron's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians. The expedition covered about 3,000 miles (4,800 km) between June and November 1749. It went up the St. Lawrence, continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario, crossed the portage at Niagara, and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie. At the Chautauqua Portage (near present-day Barcelona, New York), the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River, which it followed to the site of present-day Pittsburgh. There Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country. Whenever he encountered British merchants or fur-traders, Céloron informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.\n\nDocument 188:\nIPCC author Richard Lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the TAR. Among his criticisms, Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers (SPM) does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report. For example, Lindzen states that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models. John Houghton, who was a co-chair of TAR WGI, has responded to Lindzen's criticisms of the SPM. Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world's governments, and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence.\n\nDocument 189:\nThe IPCC Panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations. Participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged. Plenary sessions of the IPCC and IPCC Working groups are held at the level of government representatives. Non Governmental and Intergovernmental Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers. Sessions of the IPCC Bureau, workshops, expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only. Attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts. After the opening ceremonies, closed plenary sessions were held. The meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at Sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations.\n\nDocument 190:\nEconomist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as \"rent-seeking\". While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them. This process, known to economists as rent-seeking, brings income not from creation of wealth but from \"grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort\"\n\nDocument 191:\nHospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications given intravenously. This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.\n\nDocument 192:\nModern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or \"Monte Carlo\") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n\nDocument 193:\nTymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose, CA that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers (servers)at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections. The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways. (Interesting note: Tymnet was not named after Mr. Tyme. Another employee suggested the name.)  \n\nDocument 194:\nOther important complexity classes include BPP, ZPP and RP, which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines; AC and NC, which are defined using Boolean circuits; and BQP and QMA, which are defined using quantum Turing machines. #P is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems. ALL is the class of all decision problems.\n\nDocument 195:\nIn this dioxygen, the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other. The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a bond order of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or Aufbau, filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low σ and σ* orbitals; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and π overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest π and π* orbitals.\n\nDocument 196:\nThe main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.\n\nDocument 197:\nNASA's CALIPSO satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon: an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the Sahara each year, at 15 degrees west longitude, across 1,600 miles (2,600 km) over the Atlantic Ocean (some dust falls into the Atlantic), then at 35 degrees West longitude at the eastern coast of South America, 27.7 million tons (15%) of dust fall over the Amazon basin, 132 million tons of dust remain in the air, 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the Caribbean Sea, past 75 degrees west longitude.\n\nDocument 198:\nIn many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system. Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements. Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building, In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land. Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency.\n\nDocument 199:\nSeveral procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.\n\nDocument 200:\nThe Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".\n\nDocument 201:\nThe judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration. Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.\n\nDocument 202:\nDuring the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Japan absorbed Taiwan. As a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia. Korea was annexed in 1910. During World War I, Japan took German-leased territories in China’s Shandong Province, as well as the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands. In 1918, Japan occupied parts of far eastern Russia and parts of eastern Siberia as a participant in the Siberian Intervention. In 1931 Japan conquered Manchuria from China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China and by the end of the Pacific War, Japan had conquered much of the Far East, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Indonesia, part of New Guinea and some islands of the Pacific Ocean. Japan also invaded Thailand, pressuring the country into a Thai/Japanese alliance. Its colonial ambitions were ended by the victory of the United States in the Second World War and the following treaties which remanded those territories to American administration or their original owners.\n\nDocument 203:\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Cévennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Lozère. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715. Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.\n\nDocument 204:\nThough there is no official definition for the northern boundary of southern California, such a division has existed from the time when Mexico ruled California, and political disputes raged between the Californios of Monterey in the upper part and Los Angeles in the lower part of Alta California. Following the acquisition of California by the United States, the division continued as part of the attempt by several pro-slavery politicians to arrange the division of Alta California at 36 degrees, 30 minutes, the line of the Missouri Compromise. Instead, the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state, preventing southern California from becoming its own separate slave state.\n\nDocument 205:\nIn the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population. In 1656, the plague killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain. The plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half. In 1709–13, a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700–21, Sweden v. Russia and allies) killed about 100,000 in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia. The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki, and claimed a third of Stockholm's population. Europe's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in Marseille.\n\nDocument 206:\nAt the end of World War I, the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles. This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies, until 1935 and after that, it would be a demilitarised zone, with the German army forbidden to enter. The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as helping Adolf Hitler's rise to power. The allies left the Rhineland, in 1930 and the German army re-occupied it in 1936, which was enormously popular in Germany. Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler.\n\nDocument 207:\nThe outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce \"free votes\", which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on moral issues.\n\nDocument 208:\nOxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving. Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an O\n2 partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure to a O\n2 partial pressures greater than 160 kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers). Acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21% O\n2 at 66 m or more of depth; the same thing can occur by breathing 100% O\n2 at only 6 m.\n\nDocument 209:\nSouthern California consists of one of the more varied collections of geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes in a diversity outnumbering other major regions in the state and country. The region spans from Pacific Ocean islands, shorelines, beaches, and coastal plains, through the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges with their peaks, into the large and small interior valleys, to the vast deserts of California.\n\nDocument 210:\nEstablished originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.\n\nDocument 211:\nEuropean Union law is a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states. The three sources of European Union law are primary law, secondary law and supplementary law. The main sources of primary law are the Treaties establishing the European Union. Secondary sources include regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties. The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which under the Treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the Treaties.\n\nDocument 212:\nOn 23 June 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote joint letters with Ed Whitfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demanding full records on climate research, as well as personal information about their finances and careers, from Mann, Bradley and Hughes. Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, said this was a \"misguided and illegitimate investigation\" apparently aimed at intimidating scientists, and at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation. The National Research Council's report agreed that there were some statistical failings, but these had little effect on the graph, which was generally correct. In a 2006 letter to Nature, Mann, Bradley, and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that \"more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached\" and that the uncertainties were \"the point of the article\".\n\nDocument 213:\nWithin the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as pH or available iron. This reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness. However, since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an \"overgrowth\" of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection). There is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections.\n\nDocument 214:\nIt is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force. However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.\n\nDocument 215:\nFurther south the Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawba, Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw, and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes. When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict. It was not uncommon for small bands to participate on the \"other side\" of the conflict from formally negotiated agreements, as most tribes were decentralized and bands made their own decisions about warfare.\n\nDocument 216:\nThe shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations: first, at Millingen aan de Rijn, the Rhine splits into Waal and Pannerdens Kanaal, which changes its name to Nederrijn at Angeren, and second near Arnhem, the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn. This creates three main flows, two of which change names rather often. The largest and southern main branch begins as Waal and continues as Boven Merwede (\"Upper Merwede\"), Beneden Merwede (\"Lower Merwede\"), Noord River (\"North River\"), Nieuwe Maas (\"New Meuse\"), Het Scheur (\"the Rip\") and Nieuwe Waterweg (\"New Waterway\"). The middle flow begins as Nederrijn, then changes into Lek, then joins the Noord, thereby forming Nieuwe Maas. The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer. Three more flows carry significant amounts of water: the Nieuwe Merwede (\"New Merwede\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Boven to Beneden Merwede; the Oude Maas (\"Old Meuse\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Beneden Merwede into Noord, and Dordtse Kil, which branches off from Oude Maas.\n\nDocument 217:\nSome Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia. Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains. A Norman named Oursel led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans—formerly of Oursel—led by Raimbaud. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks.\" The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nDocument 218:\nStructural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks. They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area. In addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.\n\nDocument 219:\nOrientalism, as theorized by Edward Said, refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East. This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between \"we\" the West and \"them\" the East, or \"here\" in the West and \"there\" in the East. This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories.\n\nDocument 220:\nIn the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, \"Walking Into Fresno\", written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous \"WWVA Jamboree\" radio and television show in Wheeling, West Virginia. Aken, adopted by Mexican movie actress Lupe Mayorga, grew up in the neighboring town of Madera and his song chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child. Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.\n\nDocument 221:\nUntil 1932 the generally accepted length of the Rhine was 1,230 kilometres (764 miles). In 1932 the German encyclopedia Knaurs Lexikon stated the length as 1,320 kilometres (820 miles), presumably a typographical error. After this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications. The error was discovered in 2010, and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at 1,232 kilometres (766 miles).[note 1]\n\nDocument 222:\nLarge-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines. An architect normally manages the job, and a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project manager supervises it. For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential. Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements, the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction-site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc. The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects.\n\nDocument 223:\nFor some decades prior to the First Palestine Intifada in 1987, the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine took a \"quiescent\" stance towards Israel, focusing on preaching, education and social services, and benefiting from Israel's \"indulgence\" to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations. As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS (\"zeal\"), devoted to Jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada. The Brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab.\n\nDocument 224:\nPushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.\n\nDocument 225:\nThe most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population. Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110–120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.\n\nDocument 226:\nMany Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin. Two Han Chinese leaders, Shi Tianze, Liu Heima (劉黑馬, Liu Ni), and the Khitan Xiao Zhala (蕭札剌) defected and commanded the 3 Tumens in the Mongol army. Liu Heima and Shi Tianze served Ogödei Khan. Liu Heima and Shi Tianxiang led armies against Western Xia for the Mongols. There were 4 Han Tumens and 3 Khitan Tumens, with each Tumen consisting of 10,000 troops. The three Khitan Generals Shimobeidier (石抹孛迭兒), Tabuyir (塔不已兒) and Xiaozhacizhizizhongxi (蕭札刺之子重喜) commanded the three Khitan Tumens and the four Han Generals Zhang Rou, Yan Shi, Shi Tianze, and Liu Heima commanded the four Han tumens under Ogödei Khan.\n\nDocument 227:\nA particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number. If we have a number b that we want to test for primality, then we work out nb (mod b) for a random value of n as our test. A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers. Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers, though, so this test can be useful for practical purposes. More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.\n\nDocument 228:\nThis means that in a closed system of particles, there are no internal forces that are unbalanced. That is, the action-reaction force shared between any two objects in a closed system will not cause the center of mass of the system to accelerate. The constituent objects only accelerate with respect to each other, the system itself remains unaccelerated. Alternatively, if an external force acts on the system, then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.:19-1\n\nDocument 229:\nThe embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S. energy security. On an international level, the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries, such as automobiles. Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts. The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic. Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production.\n\nDocument 230:\nErgänzungsschulen are secondary or post-secondary (non-tertiary) schools, which are run by private individuals, private organizations or rarely, religious groups and offer a type of education which is not available at public schools. Most of these schools are vocational schools. However, these vocational schools are not part of the German dual education system. Ergänzungsschulen have the freedom to operate outside of government regulation and are funded in whole by charging their students tuition fees.\n\nDocument 231:\nThe Premier of Victoria is the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Premier is the public face of government and, with cabinet, sets the legislative and political agenda. Cabinet consists of representatives elected to either house of parliament. It is responsible for managing areas of government that are not exclusively the Commonwealth's, by the Australian Constitution, such as education, health and law enforcement. The current Premier of Victoria is Daniel Andrews.\n\nDocument 232:\nMany of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names. Many families, today mostly Afrikaans-speaking, have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry. Examples include: Blignaut, Cilliers, de Klerk (Le Clercq), de Villiers, du Plessis, Du Preez (Des Pres), du Randt (Durand), du Toit, Duvenhage(Du Vinage), Franck, Fouche, Fourie (Fleurit), Gervais, Giliomee (Guilliaume), Gous/Gouws (Gauch), Hugo, Jordaan (Jourdan), Joubert, Kriek, Labuschagne (la Buscagne), le Roux, Lombard, Malan, Malherbe, Marais, Maree, Minnaar (Mesnard), Nel (Nell),Naude', Nortje (Nortier), Pienaar (Pinard), Retief (Retif), Rossouw (Rousseau), Taljaard (Taillard), TerBlanche, Theron, Viljoen (Villion) and Visagie (Visage). The wine industry in South Africa owes a significant debt to the Huguenots, some of whom had vineyards in France, or were brandy distillers, and used their skills in their new home.\n\nDocument 233:\nRanging from about 1 millimeter (0.039 in) to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) in size, ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia (\"hairs\") as their main method of locomotion. Most species have eight strips, called comb rows, that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia, called \"ctenes,\" stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat, those of each comb touch the comb below. The name \"ctenophora\" means \"comb-bearing\", from the Greek κτείς (stem-form κτεν-) meaning \"comb\" and the Greek suffix -φορος meaning \"carrying\".\n\nDocument 234:\nEventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions. In the course of the Hundred Years' War, the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English. The Anglo-Norman language became distinct from the Latin language, something that was the subject of some humour by Geoffrey Chaucer. The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see Old English) and influenced it, helping (along with the Norse language of the earlier Anglo-Norse settlers and the Latin used by the church) in the development of Middle English. It in turn evolved into Modern English.\n\nDocument 235:\nMany of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, \"My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.\"\n\nDocument 236:\nBefore World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, and Chinatown. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Fresno's population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% Asian. (Incongruously, Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today Japanese-American businesses still remain). During 1942, Pinedale, in what is now North Fresno, was the site of the Pinedale Assembly Center, an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area Japanese Americans to internment camps. The Fresno Fairgrounds was also utilized as an assembly center.\n\nDocument 237:\nThese studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900, and the MBH99 based graph featured in publicity. Even at the draft stage, this finding was disputed by contrarians: in May 2000 Fred Singer's Science and Environmental Policy Project held a press event on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., featuring comments on the graph Wibjörn Karlén and Singer argued against the graph at a United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing on 18 July 2000. Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic, which he mis-identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report, and argued that \"Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report, the IPCC presented the 'Hockey Stick' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report\". Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that \"manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\". The data and methodology used to produce the \"hockey stick graph\" was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl & Ammann 2007, which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick.\n\nDocument 238:\nGeologists use a number of field, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to petrology (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface.\n\nDocument 239:\nHighly combustible materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; whereas non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process. The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products. Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston).\n\nDocument 240:\nThe concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, \"prime\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.\n\nDocument 241:\nEU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) agreement between France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the second World War. The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.\n\nDocument 242:\nEven though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.\n\nDocument 243:\nCrime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society. Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions. There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger. Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries, as well as studying areas within countries. Daly et al. 2001 found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality. They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) found a similar relationship worldwide. Among comments in academic literature on the relationship between homicides and inequality are:\n\nDocument 244:\nThe area of the modern city of Jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years. On Black Hammock Island in the national Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, a University of North Florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the United States, dating to 2500 BC. In the 16th century, the beginning of the historical era, the region was inhabited by the Mocama, a coastal subgroup of the Timucua people. At the time of contact with Europeans, all Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa, centered around the mouth of the St. Johns River. One early map shows a village called Ossachite at the site of what is now downtown Jacksonville; this may be the earliest recorded name for that area.\n\nDocument 245:\nThe Social Charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states. The UK refused to sign the Social Charter and was exempt from the legislation covering Social Charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation. The UK subsequently was the only member state to veto the Social Charter being included as the \"Social Chapter\" of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty - instead, an Agreement on Social Policy was added as a protocol. Again, the UK was exempt from legislation arising from the protocol, unless it agreed to be bound by it. The protocol was to become known as \"Social Chapter\", despite not actually being a chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. To achieve aims of the Agreement on Social Policy the European Union was to \"support and complement\" the policies of member states. The aims of the Agreement on Social Policy are:\n\nDocument 246:\nIn most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events – admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, of which there are many types.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 247:\nIn the centre of Basel, the first major city in the course of the stream, is located the \"Rhine knee\"; this is a major bend, where the overall direction of the Rhine changes from West to North. Here the High Rhine ends. Legally, the Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine. The river now flows North as Upper Rhine through the Upper Rhine Plain, which is about 300 km long and up to 40 km wide. The most important tributaries in this area are the Ill below of Strasbourg, the Neckar in Mannheim and the Main across from Mainz. In Mainz, the Rhine leaves the Upper Rhine Valley and flows through the Mainz Basin.\n\nDocument 248:\nThe neighborhood of Sunnyside is on Fresno's far southeast side, bounded by Chestnut Avenue to the West. Its major thoroughfares are Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue. Although parts of Sunnyside are within the City of Fresno, much of the neighborhood is a \"county island\" within Fresno County. Largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s, it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction. It is also the home of the Sunnyside Country Club, which maintains a golf course designed by William P. Bell.\n\nDocument 249:\nWarsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918. The Allied Armistice terms required in Article 12 that Germany withdraw from areas controlled by Russia in 1914, which included Warsaw. Germany did so, and underground leader Piłsudski returned to Warsaw on 11 November and set up what became the Second Polish Republic, with Warsaw the capital. In the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, the huge Battle of Warsaw was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city in which the capital was successfully defended and the Red Army defeated. Poland stopped by itself the full brunt of the Red Army and defeated an idea of the \"export of the revolution\".\n\nDocument 250:\nDECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.\n\nDocument 251:\nThe concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity. The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year. Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames. This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame. This principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity.\n\nDocument 252:\nInstability troubled the early years of Kublai Khan's reign. Ogedei's grandson Kaidu refused to submit to Kublai and threatened the western frontier of Kublai's domain. The hostile but weakened Song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south. Kublai secured the northeast border in 1259 by installing the hostage prince Wonjong as the ruler of Korea, making it a Mongol tributary state. Kublai was also threatened by domestic unrest. Li Tan, the son-in-law of a powerful official, instigated a revolt against Mongol rule in 1262. After successfully suppressing the revolt, Kublai curbed the influence of the Han Chinese advisers in his court. He feared that his dependence on Chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the Song.\n\nDocument 253:\nFrom the mid-2000s, the university began a number of multimillion-dollar expansion projects. In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the Milton Friedman Institute which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members and students. The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary. During the same year, investor David G. Booth donated $300 million to the university's Booth School of Business, which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school. In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway. Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center. In 2014 the University launched the public phase of a $4.5 billion fundraising campaign. In September 2015, the University received $100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies.\n\nDocument 254:\nParliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber. A \"General Question Time\" takes place on a Thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government. At 2.30pm, a 40-minute long themed \"Question Time\" takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between 12 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction. Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions. Such a practice enables a \"lead-in\" to the questioner, who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister any issue. The four general questions available to opposition leaders are:\n\nDocument 255:\nThe Ottoman Empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1923. During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire controlling much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, the Caucasus, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states. Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.\n\nDocument 256:\nWith two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other (quartered). When the double expansion group is duplicated, producing a 4-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180°, the groups being set at 90° to each other. In one case (the first type of Vauclain compound), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90° as for a two-cylinder engine. With the 3-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90° with the HP one at 135° to the other two, or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120°.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 257:\n\"The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’, or simply ‘rule’\". The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.\n\nDocument 258:\nThere were 158,349 households, of which 68,511 (43.3%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 69,284 (43.8%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 30,547 (19.3%) had a female householder with no husband present, 11,698 (7.4%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 12,843 (8.1%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 1,388 (0.9%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 35,064 households (22.1%) were made up of individuals and 12,344 (7.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.07. There were 111,529 families (70.4% of all households); the average family size was 3.62.\n\nDocument 259:\nHistorically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.\n\nDocument 260:\nThe origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs. These \"Maxwell Equations\" fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges, and the interactions of the fields themselves. This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be \"self-generating\" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light. This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nDocument 261:\nPrivate schooling in the United States has been debated by educators, lawmakers and parents, since the beginnings of compulsory education in Massachusetts in 1852. The Supreme Court precedent appears to favor educational choice, so long as states may set standards for educational accomplishment. Some of the most relevant Supreme Court case law on this is as follows: Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923).\n\nDocument 262:\nNotable alumni in the field of government and politics include the founder of modern community organizing Saul Alinsky, Obama campaign advisor and top political advisor to President Bill Clinton David Axelrod, Attorney General and federal judge Robert Bork, Attorney General Ramsey Clark, Prohibition agent Eliot Ness, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King, 11th Prime Minister of Poland Marek Belka, Governor of the Bank of Japan Masaaki Shirakawa, the first female African-American Senator Carol Moseley Braun, United States Senator from Vermont and 2016 Democratic Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders, and former World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz.\n\nDocument 263:\nLong-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.\n\nDocument 264:\nAfter the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 began the Second World War, Warsaw was defended till September 27. Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a German Nazi colonial administration. All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw's entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city – herded into the Warsaw Ghetto. The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe. When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler's \"Final Solution\" on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the Ghetto held out for almost a month. When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.\n\nDocument 265:\nA few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nDocument 266:\nThe Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal and nuclear power plants. It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish polymath.\n\nDocument 267:\nThe British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater, led to the fall from power of Newcastle and his principal military advisor, the Duke of Cumberland. Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops, supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces.\n\nDocument 268:\nOther forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists. The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.\n\nDocument 269:\nThe Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots. Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship. The height of this persecution was the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed, although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern France. Retaliating against the French Catholics, the Huguenots had their own militia.\n\nDocument 270:\nAfter World War II, under a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets, the \"Bricks for Warsaw\" campaign was initiated, and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the housing shortage, along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city, such as the Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet Union. The city resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country's centre of political and economic life. Many of the historic streets, buildings, and churches were restored to their original form. In 1980, Warsaw's historic Old Town was inscribed onto UNESCO's World Heritage list.\n\nDocument 271:\nThe project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements. Constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner. Some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations, or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions. Other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations, or things that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district. An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built, either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design will not cause a collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community).\n\nDocument 272:\nSince the 1920s, motion pictures, petroleum and aircraft manufacturing have been major industries. In one of the richest agricultural regions in the U.S., cattle and citrus were major industries until farmlands were turned into suburbs. Although military spending cutbacks have had an impact, aerospace continues to be a major factor.\n\nDocument 273:\nConstruction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems. Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project. Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough. Fraud is a problem in many fields, but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field. Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project.\n\nDocument 274:\nMany types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, quantum Turing machines, symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.\n\nDocument 275:\nThe Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amazônica or Amazônia; Spanish: Selva Amazónica, Amazonía or usually Amazonia; French: Forêt amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain \"Amazonas\" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.\n\nDocument 276:\nSome civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution. In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U.S. Navy property argued to the court in allocution that \"the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy\". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions. Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.\n\nDocument 277:\nThe French Protestant Church of London was established by Royal Charter in 1550. It is now located at Soho Square. Huguenot refugees flocked to Shoreditch, London. They established a major weaving industry in and around Spitalfields (see Petticoat Lane and the Tenterground) in East London. In Wandsworth, their gardening skills benefited the Battersea market gardens. The Old Truman Brewery, then known as the Black Eagle Brewery, was founded in 1724. The flight of Huguenot refugees from Tours, France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built.[citation needed] Some of these immigrants moved to Norwich, which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers. The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.\n\nDocument 278:\nThe Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government's benefits agency was checking claimants' \"Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone\" – as, it claimed, subscription to sports channels would betray a man's presence in the household. In December, the UK’s parliament heard a claim that a subscription to BSkyB was ‘often damaging’, along with alcohol, tobacco and gambling. Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a \"Welfare Cash Card\", in the style of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, that could be used to buy only \"essentials\".\n\nDocument 279:\nIn many parts of the United States, after the 1954 decision in the landmark court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that demanded United States schools desegregate \"with all deliberate speed\", local families organized a wave of private \"Christian academies\". In much of the U.S. South, many white students migrated to the academies, while public schools became in turn more heavily concentrated with African-American students (see List of private schools in Mississippi). The academic content of the academies was usually College Preparatory. Since the 1970s, many of these \"segregation academies\" have shut down, although some continue to operate.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 280:\nEven before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with Wales. Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the Marches and warring with the Welsh. In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.\n\nDocument 281:\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.\n\nDocument 282:\nThe Rhine emerges from Lake Constance, flows generally westward, as the Hochrhein, passes the Rhine Falls, and is joined by its major tributary, the river Aare. The Aare more than doubles the Rhine's water discharge, to an average of nearly 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s), and provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the Dutch border. The Aare also contains the waters from the 4,274 m (14,022 ft) summit of Finsteraarhorn, the highest point of the Rhine basin. The Rhine roughly forms the German-Swiss border from Lake Constance with the exceptions of the canton of Schaffhausen and parts of the cantons of Zürich and Basel-Stadt, until it turns north at the so-called Rhine knee at Basel, leaving Switzerland.\n\nDocument 283:\nThe city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese (left bank of the Vistula) and diocese (right bank), and possesses various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw, two opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries and monuments. The historic city-centre of Warsaw with its picturesque Old Town in 1980 was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other main architectural attractions include the Castle Square with the Royal Castle and the iconic King Sigismund's Column, St. John's Cathedral, Market Square, palaces, churches and mansions all displaying a richness of colour and architectural detail. Buildings represent examples of nearly every European architectural style and historical period. Warsaw provides many examples of architecture from the gothic, renaissance, baroque and neoclassical periods, and around a quarter of the city is filled with luxurious parks and royal gardens.\n\nDocument 284:\nFresno (/ˈfrɛznoʊ/ FREZ-noh), the county seat of Fresno County, is a city in the U.S. state of California. As of 2015, the city's population was 520,159, making it the fifth-largest city in California, the largest inland city in California and the 34th-largest in the nation. Fresno is in the center of the San Joaquin Valley and is the largest city in the Central Valley, which contains the San Joaquin Valley. It is approximately 220 miles (350 km) northwest of Los Angeles, 170 miles (270 km) south of the state capital, Sacramento, or 185 miles (300 km) south of San Francisco. The name Fresno means \"ash tree\" in Spanish, and an ash leaf is featured on the city's flag.\n\nDocument 285:\nThe Mallee and upper Wimmera are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby semi-deserts. Average temperatures exceed 32 °C (90 °F) during summer and 15 °C (59 °F) in winter. Except at cool mountain elevations, the inland monthly temperatures are 2–7 °C (4–13 °F) warmer than around Melbourne (see chart). Victoria's highest maximum temperature since World War II, of 48.8 °C (119.8 °F) was recorded in Hopetoun on 7 February 2009, during the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave.\n\nDocument 286:\nThe Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at Bannow Bay in 1169. Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\" The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice. Other families bearing such surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De Búrca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.\n\nDocument 287:\nSince the Peace of Westphalia, the Upper Rhine formed a contentious border between France and Germany. Establishing \"natural borders\" on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy, since the Middle Ages, though the language border was – and is – far more to the west. French leaders, such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine. The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon, as a French client state, in 1806 and lasted until 1814, during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the First French Empire. In 1840, the Rhine crisis, prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers's desire to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border, led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in Germany.\n\nDocument 288:\nThe crisis reduced the demand for large cars. Japanese imports, primarily the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun 510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.\n\nDocument 289:\nare prime. Prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes. Other primes where either p + 1 or p − 1 is of a particular shape include the Sophie Germain primes (primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime), primorial primes, Fermat primes and Mersenne primes, that is, prime numbers that are of the form 2p − 1, where p is an arbitrary prime. The Lucas–Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form. This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers.\n\nDocument 290:\nPeople who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental O\n2 supplies.[h] Passengers traveling in (pressurized) commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of O\n2 automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization. Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop. Pulling on the masks \"to start the flow of oxygen\" as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister. A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.\n\nDocument 291:\nWarsaw's first stock exchange was established in 1817 and continued trading until World War II. It was re-established in April 1991, following the end of the post-war communist control of the country and the reintroduction of a free-market economy. Today, the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) is, according to many indicators, the largest market in the region, with 374 companies listed and total capitalization of 162 584 mln EUR as of 31 August 2009. From 1991 until 2000, the stock exchange was, ironically, located in the building previously used as the headquarters of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR).\n\nDocument 292:\nOxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO\n2). The Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon (silica SiO\n2, as found in granite and quartz), aluminium (aluminium oxide Al\n2O\n3, in bauxite and corundum), iron (iron(III) oxide Fe\n2O\n3, in hematite and rust), and calcium carbonate (in limestone). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex silicates (in silicate minerals). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.\n\nDocument 293:\nThe quick and decisive defeat of the Arab troops during the Six-Day War by Israeli troops constituted a pivotal event in the Arab Muslim world. The defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries, was blamed on the secular Arab nationalism of the ruling regimes. A steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular, socialist and nationalist politics ensued. Ba'athism, Arab socialism, and Arab nationalism suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic Islamist movements inspired by Maududi and Sayyid Qutb gained ground.\n\nDocument 294:\nOn the other hand, higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level (self-employment). However, most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity. Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter (\"push\" motivations), whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations (\"pull\") such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products, services, or underserved market needs. The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.\n\nDocument 295:\nChemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.\n\nDocument 296:\nAround 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in Brandenburg-Prussia, where they were granted special privileges (Edict of Potsdam) and churches in which to worship (such as the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde) by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia. The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich). Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of Baden, Franconia (Principality of Bayreuth, Principality of Ansbach), Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, Duchy of Württemberg, in the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, in the Palatinate and Palatinate-Zweibrücken, in the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt), in modern-day Saarland; and 1,500 found refuge in Hamburg, Bremen and Lower Saxony. Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Celle.\n\nDocument 297:\nMaududi also believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia, and Islam required the establishment of an Islamic state. This state should be a \"theo-democracy,\" based on the principles of: tawhid (unity of God), risala (prophethood) and khilafa (caliphate). Although Maududi talked about Islamic revolution, by \"revolution\" he meant not the violence or populist policies of the Iranian Revolution, but the gradual changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah.\n\nDocument 298:\nSinglet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular O\n2 in which all the electron spins are paired. It is much more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se. In nature, singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight. It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength, and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen. Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly also in animals) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.\n\nDocument 299:\nSome disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language. The \"Hugues hypothesis\" argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation. He was regarded by the Gallicans and Protestants as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo.\n\nDocument 300:\nA job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.\n\nDocument 301:\nSubsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including Bernard de Neufmarché, Roger of Montgomery in Shropshire and Hugh Lupus in Cheshire. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as baron (barwn), first entered Welsh at that time.\n\nDocument 302:\nIn the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including Australia and Canada, the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions. Private education in North America covers the whole gamut of educational activity, ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions. Annual tuition fees at K-12 schools range from nothing at so called 'tuition-free' schools to more than $45,000 at several New England preparatory schools.\n\nDocument 303:\nDuring the divestment from South Africa movement in the late 1980s, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech given by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown. The Harvard Management Company repeatedly refused to divest, stating that \"operating expenses must not be subject to financially unrealistic strictures or carping by the unsophisticated or by special interest groups.\" However, the university did eventually reduce its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.\n\nDocument 304:\nEmperor Gegeen Khan, Ayurbarwada's son and successor, ruled for only two years, from 1321 to 1323. He continued his father's policies to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor Baiju. During his reign, the Da Yuan Tong Zhi (Chinese: 大元通制, \"the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan\"), a huge collection of codes and regulations of the Yuan dynasty begun by his father, was formally promulgated. Gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction, perhaps steppe elite opposed to Confucian reforms. They placed Yesün Temür (or Taidingdi) on the throne, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to calm the princes, he also succumbed to regicide.\n\nDocument 305:\nIn April 1191 Richard the Lion-hearted left Messina with a large fleet in order to reach Acre. But a storm dispersed the fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fiancée Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's despot Isaac Komnenos. On 1 May 1191, Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Limassol on Cyprus. He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure. Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol.\n\nDocument 306:\nExceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war (like mentioned Kronenberg Palace and Insurance Company Rosja building) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style (like Warsaw Philharmony edifice originally inspired by Palais Garnier in Paris). Despite that the Warsaw University of Technology building (1899–1902) is the most interesting of the late 19th-century architecture. Some 19th-century buildings in the Praga district (the Vistula’s right bank) have been restored although many have been poorly maintained. Warsaw’s municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild the Saxon Palace and the Brühl Palace, the most distinctive buildings in prewar Warsaw.\n\nDocument 307:\nOn 18 November 2015, Sky announced Sky Q, a range of products and services to be available in 2016. The Sky Q range consists of three set top boxes (Sky Q, Sky Q Silver and Sky Q Mini), a broadband router (Sky Q Hub) and mobile applications. The Sky Q set top boxes introduce a new user interface, Wi-Fi hotspot functionality, Power-line and Bluetooth connectivity and a new touch-sensitive remote control. The Sky Q Mini set top boxes connect to the Sky Q Silver set top boxes with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds. This allows all set top boxes in a household to share recordings and other media. The Sky Q Silver set top box is capable of receiving and displaying UHD broadcasts, which Sky will introduce later in 2016.\n\nDocument 308:\nWarsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country. During the Second World War, Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction. After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL. Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed. However, some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. Leopold Kronenberg Palace). Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries.\n\nDocument 309:\nIn 2014, economists with the Standard & Poor's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the U.S.'s wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to boom-and-bust cycles. To partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth, S&P recommended increasing access to education. It estimated that if the average United States worker had completed just one more year of school, it would add an additional $105 billion in growth to the country's economy over five years.\n\nDocument 310:\nUndergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as \"more selective, lower transfer-in\". Harvard College accepted 5.3% of applicants for the class of 2019, a record low and the second lowest acceptance rate among all national universities. Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities, yet for the class of 2016 an Early Action program was reintroduced.\n\nDocument 311:\nOxygen condenses at 90.20 K (−182.95 °C, −297.31 °F), and freezes at 54.36 K (−218.79 °C, −361.82 °F). Both liquid and solid O\n2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light). High-purity liquid O\n2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air, using liquid nitrogen as a coolant. It is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.\n\nDocument 312:\nConnection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication. The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking. Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table. The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets.\n\nDocument 313:\nThe U.S. government has engaged in efforts to counter Islamism, or violent Islamism, since 2001. These efforts were centred in the U.S. around public diplomacy programmes conducted by the State Department. There have been calls to create an independent agency in the U.S. with a specific mission of undermining Islamism and jihadism. Christian Whiton, an official in the George W. Bush administration, called for a new agency focused on the nonviolent practice of \"political warfare\" aimed at undermining the ideology. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for establishing something similar to the defunct U.S. Information Agency, which was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the Cold War.\n\nDocument 314:\nAn Islamist movement influenced by Salafism and the jihad in Afghanistan, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, was the FIS or Front Islamique de Salut (the Islamic Salvation Front) in Algeria. Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by Abbassi Madani, and a charismatic Islamist young preacher, Ali Belhadj. Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men. The FIS won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'état.\n\nDocument 315:\nHarvard's faculty includes scholars such as biologist E. O. Wilson, cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, physicists Lisa Randall and Roy Glauber, chemists Elias Corey, Dudley R. Herschbach and George M. Whitesides, computer scientists Michael O. Rabin and Leslie Valiant, Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt, writer Louis Menand, critic Helen Vendler, historians Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Niall Ferguson, economists Amartya Sen, N. Gregory Mankiw, Robert Barro, Stephen A. Marglin, Don M. Wilson III and Martin Feldstein, political philosophers Harvey Mansfield, Baroness Shirley Williams and Michael Sandel, Fields Medalist mathematician Shing-Tung Yau, political scientists Robert Putnam, Joseph Nye, and Stanley Hoffmann, scholar/composers Robert Levin and Bernard Rands, astrophysicist Alyssa A. Goodman, and legal scholars Alan Dershowitz and Lawrence Lessig.\n\nDocument 316:\nThe Yuan dynasty (Chinese: 元朝; pinyin: Yuán Cháo), officially the Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元; pinyin: Dà Yuán; Mongolian: Yehe Yuan Ulus[a]), was the empire or ruling dynasty of China established by Kublai Khan, leader of the Mongolian Borjigin clan. Although the Mongols had ruled territories including today's North China for decades, it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style. His realm was, by this point, isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of present-day China and its surrounding areas, including modern Mongolia and Korea. It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty. Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language, while others only used their native language (i.e. Mongolian) and the 'Phags-pa script.\n\nDocument 317:\nGamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) possess an alternative T cell receptor (TCR) as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.\n\nDocument 318:\nIt is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the Wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine. Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 319:\nApproximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2% of its population. Most are concentrated in Alsace in northeast France and the Cévennes mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day.[citation needed] A diaspora of French Australians still considers itself Huguenot, even after centuries of exile. Long integrated into Australian society, it is encouraged by the Huguenot Society of Australia to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage, aided by the Society's genealogical research services.\n\nDocument 320:\nLegally, only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in India. They will have to satisfy a number of infrastructure and human resource related criteria to get Recognition (a form of license) from the government. Critics of this system point out that this leads to corruption by school inspectors who check compliance and to fewer schools in a country that has the largest adult illiterate population in the world. While official data does not capture the real extent of private schooling in the country, various studies have reported unpopularity of government schools and an increasing number of private schools. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which evaluates learning levels in rural India, has been reporting poorer academic achievement in government schools than in private schools. A key difference between the government and private schools is that the medium of education in private schools is English while it is the local language in government schools.\n\nDocument 321:\nFor certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.\n\nDocument 322:\nFor many years, Sudan had an Islamist regime under the leadership of Hassan al-Turabi. His National Islamic Front first gained influence when strongman General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979. Turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia. He also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education.\n\nDocument 323:\nIf the input size is n, the time taken can be expressed as a function of n. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n. If T(n) is a polynomial in n, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm. Cobham's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.\n\nDocument 324:\nThe economy of Victoria is highly diversified: service sectors including financial and property services, health, education, wholesale, retail, hospitality and manufacturing constitute the majority of employment. Victoria's total gross state product (GSP) is ranked second in Australia, although Victoria is ranked fourth in terms of GSP per capita because of its limited mining activity. Culturally, Melbourne is home to a number of museums, art galleries and theatres and is also described as the \"sporting capital of Australia\". The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium in Australia, and the host of the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The ground is also considered the \"spiritual home\" of Australian cricket and Australian rules football, and hosts the grand final of the Australian Football League (AFL) each year, usually drawing crowds of over 95,000 people. Victoria includes eight public universities, with the oldest, the University of Melbourne, having been founded in 1853.\n\nDocument 325:\nAccording to International Monetary Fund economists, inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth). High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education. According to IMF staff economists, \"if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels.\"\n\nDocument 326:\nOther green spaces in the city include the Botanic Garden and the University Library garden. They have extensive botanical collection of rare domestic and foreign plants, while a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world. Besides, within the city borders, there are also: Pole Mokotowskie (a big park in the northern Mokotów, where was the first horse racetrack and then the airport), Park Ujazdowski (close to the Sejm and John Lennon street), Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin, by the southern city border, Park Skaryszewski by the right Vistula bank, in Praga. The oldest park in Praga, the Praga Park, was established in 1865–1871 and designed by Jan Dobrowolski. In 1927 a zoological garden (Ogród Zoologiczny) was established on the park grounds, and in 1952 a bear run, still open today.\n\nDocument 327:\nMuch of the city's tax base dissipated, leading to problems with funding education, sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits. In addition, residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services, such as sewage and building code enforcement. In 1958, a study recommended that the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county. Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965.\n\nDocument 328:\nUniversity of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics, the Chicago school of sociology, the law and economics movement in legal analysis, the Chicago school of literary criticism, the Chicago school of religion, and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world-renowned institutions like the nearby Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.\n\nDocument 329:\nAlmost all species are hermaphrodites, in other words they function as both males and females at the same time – except that in two species of the genus Ocryopsis individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives. The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is external in most species, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.\n\nDocument 330:\nThe First British Empire was based on mercantilism, and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India. Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776. Britain made compensating gains in India, Australia, and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies about 1820. By the 1840s, Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world. After losing its first Empire to the Americans, Britain then turned its attention towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe. Increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century.\n\nDocument 331:\nReactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (O−\n2) and hydrogen peroxide (H\n2O\n2), are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms. Parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack. Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O\n2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event, about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms.\n\nDocument 332:\nThe University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's $37.6 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution.\n\nDocument 333:\nMost Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction, with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface. They cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular \"foot\". All but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows. Platyctenids are usually cryptically colored, live on rocks, algae, or the body surfaces of other invertebrates, and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches, seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current.\n\nDocument 334:\nThe National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States. NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks operating at speeds of 56 kbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s (T1), and 45 Mbit/s (T3) that were constructed to support NSF's networking initiatives from 1985-1995. Initially created to link researchers to the nation's NSF-funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone.\n\nDocument 335:\nIn particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p, in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers. These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.\n\nDocument 336:\nNew techniques of building construction are being researched, made possible by advances in 3D printing technology. In a form of additive building construction, similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts, building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours, with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities, in one continuous build, using large 3D printers. Working versions of 3D-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) of building material per hour as of January 2013[update], with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres (11 ft) per hour, sufficient to complete a building in a week. Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars's performative architecture 3D-printed building is scheduled to be built in 2014.\n\nDocument 337:\nMany faults are able to produce a magnitude 6.7+ earthquake, such as the San Andreas Fault, which can produce a magnitude 8.0 event. Other faults include the San Jacinto Fault, the Puente Hills Fault, and the Elsinore Fault Zone. The USGS has released a California Earthquake forecast which models Earthquake occurrence in California.\n\nDocument 338:\nSociologist Jake Rosenfield of the University of Washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization, which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that didn't experience steep surges in inequality. He points out that nations with high rates of unionization, particularly in Scandinavia, have very low levels of inequality, and concludes \"the historical pattern is clear; the cross-national pattern is clear: high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa.\"\n\nDocument 339:\nSteven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty, \"they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience.\" A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense. In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and United States v. Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.\n\nDocument 340:\nTorque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position, angular velocity for velocity, and angular momentum for momentum. As a consequence of Newton's First Law of Motion, there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque. Likewise, Newton's Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body:\n\nDocument 341:\nAll of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.:12-11:359\n\nDocument 342:\nAn important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\"; this is known as a \"creative plea,\" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.\n\nDocument 343:\nAs well as creating rights for \"workers\" who generally lack bargaining power in the market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the \"freedom of establishment\" in article 49, and \"freedom to provide services\" in article 56. In Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be \"established\" means to participate in economic life \"on a stable and continuous basis\", while providing \"services\" meant pursuing activity more \"on a temporary basis\". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or \"undertakings\" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise \"official authority\", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.\n\nDocument 344:\nOne of the principal advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. Gas turbines, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 345:\nThe first item of business on Wednesdays is usually Time for Reflection, at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of faith. This contrasts with the formal style of \"Prayers\", which is the first item of business in meetings of the House of Commons. Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the Scottish census. Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau. Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers.\n\nDocument 346:\nWarsaw is located on two main geomorphologic formations: the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley with its asymmetrical pattern of different terraces. The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right. The left one is situated both on the moraine plateau (10 to 25 m (32.8 to 82.0 ft) above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. 6.5 m (21.3 ft) above Vistula level). The significant element of the relief, in this part of Warsaw, is the edge of moraine plateau called Warsaw Escarpment. It is 20 to 25 m (65.6 to 82.0 ft) high in the Old Town and Central district and about 10 m (32.8 ft) in the north and south of Warsaw. It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.\n\nDocument 347:\nBefore Rollo's arrival, its populations did not differ from Picardy or the Île-de-France, which were considered \"Frankish\". Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes, Norwegians, Norse–Gaels, Orkney Vikings, possibly Swedes, and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control.\n\nDocument 348:\nNormandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century. Fécamp Abbey and Saint-Evroul Abbey were centres of musical production and education. At Fécamp, under two Italian abbots, William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at Fécamp, the staff, around which neumes were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot Isembard, La Trinité-du-Mont became a centre of musical composition.\n\nDocument 349:\nWhen a consolidation referendum was held in 1967, voters approved the plan. On October 1, 1968, the governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville. Fire, police, health & welfare, recreation, public works, and housing & urban development were all combined under the new government. In honor of the occasion, then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the \"Bold New City of the South\" at Florida 13 and Julington Creek. The Better Jacksonville Plan, promoted as a blueprint for Jacksonville's future and approved by Jacksonville voters in 2000, authorized a half-penny sales tax. This would generate most of the revenue required for the $2.25 billion package of major projects that included road & infrastructure improvements, environmental preservation, targeted economic development and new or improved public facilities.\n\nDocument 350:\nHuguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country, but rather, formed three societies or congregations; one in the city of New York, another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named New Rochelle, and a third further upstate in New Paltz. The \"Huguenot Street Historic District\" in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains the oldest street in the United States of America. A small group of Huguenots also settled on the south shore of Staten Island along the New York Harbor, for which the current neighborhood of Huguenot was named.\n\nDocument 351:\nFor example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time.\n\nDocument 352:\nIn literature, author of the New York Times bestseller Before I Fall Lauren Oliver, Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Philip Roth, Canadian-born Pulitzer Prize and Nobel Prize for Literature winning writer Saul Bellow, political philosopher, literary critic and author of the New York Times bestseller \"The Closing of the American Mind\" Allan Bloom, ''The Good War\" author Studs Terkel, American writer, essayist, filmmaker, teacher, and political activist Susan Sontag, analytic philosopher and Stanford University Professor of Comparative Literature Richard Rorty, and American writer and satirist Kurt Vonnegut are notable alumni.\n\nDocument 353:\nIn 1965, at the instigation of Warner Sinback, a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE's four computer sales and service centers (Schenectady, Phoenix, Chicago, and Phoenix) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service, apparently the world's first commercial online service. (In addition to selling GE computers, the centers were computer service bureaus, offering batch processing services. They lost money from the beginning, and Sinback, a high-level marketing manager, was given the job of turning the business around. He decided that a time-sharing system, based on Kemney's work at Dartmouth—which used a computer on loan from GE—could be profitable. Warner was right.)\n\nDocument 354:\nAfter al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections, but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military. Turabi was noted for proclaiming his support for the democratic process and a liberal government before coming to power, but strict application of sharia law, torture and mass imprisonment of the opposition, and an intensification of the long-running war in southern Sudan, once in power. The NIF regime also harbored Osama bin Laden for a time (before 9/11), and worked to unify Islamist opposition to the American attack on Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nDocument 355:\nHypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I – IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.\n\nDocument 356:\nWhile most Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription. Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.\n\nDocument 357:\nThe War of the Austrian Succession (whose North American theater is known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. The treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America were turned over to a commission to resolve, but it reached no decision. Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south, were claimed by both sides. The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean, where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.\n\nDocument 358:\nThe rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard. Among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman, jaguar, cougar, and anaconda. In the river, electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill, while piranha are known to bite and injure humans. Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh. There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors. Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus. Malaria, yellow fever and Dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region.\n\nDocument 359:\nCivil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Bedau writes, \"There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.\" Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna, a 180-foot (55 m)-tall, 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days, successfully preventing it from being cut down.\n\nDocument 360:\nIn the aftermath of generally poor French results in most theaters of the Seven Years' War in 1758, France's new foreign minister, the duc de Choiseul, decided to focus on an invasion of Britain, to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland. The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France, and sent funds to Britain's ally on the mainland, Prussia, and the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay. In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships managed to depart France, eluding the British blockade of the French coast.\n\nDocument 361:\nTheir local rivals, Polonia Warsaw, have significantly fewer supporters, yet they managed to win Ekstraklasa Championship in 2000. They also won the country’s championship in 1946, and won the cup twice as well. Polonia's home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, a ten-minute walk north from the Old Town. Polonia was relegated from the country's top flight in 2013 because of their disastrous financial situation. They are now playing in the 4th league (5th tier in Poland) -the bottom professional league in the National – Polish Football Association (PZPN) structure.\n\nDocument 362:\nSince 7500 yr ago, a situation with tides and currents, very similar to present has existed. Rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far, that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes together, could compensate the transgression by the sea; in the last 7000 years, the coast line was roughly at the same location. In the southern North Sea, due to ongoing tectonic subsidence, the sea level is still rising, at the rate of about 1–3 cm (0.39–1.18 in) per century (1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years).\n\nDocument 363:\nAs northwest Europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward, frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring. Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension. Rapid warming and changes of vegetation, to open forest, began about 13,000 BP. By 9000 BP, Europe was fully forested. With globally shrinking ice-cover, ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated. Meltwater, adding to the ocean and land subsidence, drowned the former coasts of Europe transgressionally.\n\nDocument 364:\nAfter the 1940s, the Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles. In 1955, Eero Saarinen was contracted to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen); a series of arts buildings; a building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the university's School of Social Service Administration;, a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone, and the Regenstein Library, the largest building on campus, a brutalist structure designed by Walter Netsch of the Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, and other construction, expansions, and restorations. In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.\n\nDocument 365:\nIslamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for Islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect Islam, while the contrary idea that Islam is, or can be, apolitical is an error. Scholars and observers who do not believe that Islam is merely a political ideology include Fred Halliday, John Esposito and Muslim intellectuals like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi. Hayri Abaza argues the failure to distinguish between Islam and Islamism leads many in the West to support illiberal Islamic regimes, to the detriment of progressive moderates who seek to separate religion from politics.\n\nDocument 366:\nFrom the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.\n\nDocument 367:\nThe word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries. However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: φαρμακεία) derives from pharmakon (φάρμακον), meaning \"drug\", \"medicine\" (or \"poison\").[n 1]\n\nDocument 368:\nOne computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100. However, simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.\n\nDocument 369:\nThe name Rijn, from here on, is used only for smaller streams farther to the north, which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times. Though they retained the name, these streams no longer carry water from the Rhine, but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders. From Wijk bij Duurstede, the old north branch of the Rhine is called Kromme Rijn (\"Bent Rhine\") past Utrecht, first Leidse Rijn (\"Rhine of Leiden\") and then, Oude Rijn (\"Old Rhine\"). The latter flows west into a sluice at Katwijk, where its waters can be discharged into the North Sea. This branch once formed the line along which the Limes Germanicus were built. During periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages, the Rhine took a left turn, creating the Channel River, the course of which now lies below the English Channel.\n\nDocument 370:\nNormans came into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings, such as Robert the Bruce, as well as founding a considerable number of the Scottish clans. King David I of Scotland, whose elder brother Alexander I had married Sybilla of Normandy, was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland, part of the process some scholars call the \"Davidian Revolution\". Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England (married to David's sister Maud of Scotland), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under William the Lion. The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\n\nDocument 371:\nThe University of Chicago is governed by a board of trustees. The Board of Trustees oversees the long-term development and plans of the university and manages fundraising efforts, and is composed of 50 members including the university President. Directly beneath the President are the Provost, fourteen Vice Presidents (including the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, and Dean of Students of the university), the Directors of Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab, the Secretary of the university, and the Student Ombudsperson. As of August 2009[update], the Chairman of the Board of Trustees is Andrew Alper, and the President of the university is Robert Zimmer. In December 2013 it was announced that the Director of Argonne National Laboratory, Eric Isaacs, would become Provost. Isaacs was replaced as Provost in March 2016 by Daniel Diermeier. \n\nDocument 372:\nIn February 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the Fourth Assessment Report, five climate scientists – all contributing or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes to the IPCC. They suggested a range of new organizational options, from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors, to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body, or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated \"living\" Wikipedia-IPCC. Other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference.\n\nDocument 373:\nHT does not engage in armed jihad or work for a democratic system, but works to take power through \"ideological struggle\" to change Muslim public opinion, and in particular through elites who will \"facilitate\" a \"change of the government,\" i.e., launch a \"bloodless\" coup. It allegedly attempted and failed such coups in 1968 and 1969 in Jordan, and in 1974 in Egypt, and is now banned in both countries. But many HT members have gone on to join terrorist groups and many jihadi terrorists have cited HT as their key influence.\n\nDocument 374:\nAppleTalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc. in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers. It was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 90s. AppleTalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server. The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required inter-network routing. It was a plug-n-play system.\n\nDocument 375:\nIn 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.\n\nDocument 376:\nIn the United States, scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973. The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil. Further, interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger's dominance. In the US production, distribution and price disruptions \"have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth.\"\n\nDocument 377:\nThe working fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system, where the working fluid is recycled continuously, or may be an \"open loop\" system, where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere, and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied. Normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties, such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, low cost, and its thermodynamic properties. Mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine. Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle.\n\nDocument 378:\nOxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports. Oxygen bars are establishments, found in Japan, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O\n2 exposure for a fee. Professional athletes, especially in American football, also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a \"boost\" in performance. The pharmacological effect is doubtful; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation. Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O\n2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise.\n\nDocument 379:\nThe Saxon Garden, covering the area of 15.5 ha, was formally a royal garden. There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The Łazienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilanów Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Królikarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.\n\nDocument 380:\nSince September 2004, the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.\n\nDocument 381:\nBy far the most famous work of Norman art is the Bayeux Tapestry, which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery. It was commissioned by Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux and first Earl of Kent, employing natives from Kent who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the Danish Vikings.\n\nDocument 382:\nIn September 1760, and before any hostilities erupted, Governor Vaudreuil negotiated from Montreal a capitulation with General Amherst. Amherst granted Vaudreuil's request that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes. The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.\n\nDocument 383:\nAlong the same lines, co-NP is the class containing the complement problems (i.e. problems with the yes/no answers reversed) of NP problems. It is believed that NP is not equal to co-NP; however, it has not yet been proven. It has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then P is not equal to NP.\n\nDocument 384:\nThe pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.\n\nDocument 385:\nToday, Warsaw has some of the best medical facilities in Poland and East-Central Europe. The city is home to the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI), the highest-reference hospital in all of Poland, as well as an active research and education center. While the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology it is one of the largest and most modern oncological institutions in Europe. The clinical section is located in a 10-floor building with 700 beds, 10 operating theatres, an intensive care unit, several diagnostic departments as well as an outpatient clinic. The infrastructure has developed a lot over the past years.\n\nDocument 386:\nHarvard has several athletic facilities, such as the Lavietes Pavilion, a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the \"MAC\", serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held, an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes. It is home to Harvard volleyball, fencing and wrestling. The offices of several of the school's varsity coaches are also in the MAC.\n\nDocument 387:\nSome buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.\n\nDocument 388:\nThe first commercially successful true engine, in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712. It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable \"head\". Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.\n\nDocument 389:\nTamara de Lempicka was a famous artist born in Warsaw. She was born Maria Górska in Warsaw to wealthy parents and in 1916 married a Polish lawyer Tadeusz Łempicki. Better than anyone else she represented the Art Deco style in painting and art. Nathan Alterman, the Israeli poet, was born in Warsaw, as was Moshe Vilenski, the Israeli composer, lyricist, and pianist, who studied music at the Warsaw Conservatory. Warsaw was the beloved city of Isaac Bashevis Singer, which he described in many of his novels: Warsaw has just now been destroyed. No one will ever see the Warsaw I knew. Let me just write about it. Let this Warsaw not disappear forever, he commented.\n\nDocument 390:\nThe Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine. The actual number of legions present at any base or in all, depended on whether a state or threat of war existed. Between about AD 14 and 180, the assignment of legions was as follows: for the army of Germania Inferior, two legions at Vetera (Xanten), I Germanica and XX Valeria (Pannonian troops); two legions at oppidum Ubiorum (\"town of the Ubii\"), which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina, descending to Cologne, V Alaudae, a Celtic legion recruited from Gallia Narbonensis and XXI, possibly a Galatian legion from the other side of the empire.\n\nDocument 391:\nBoth X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>\n\nDocument 392:\nThere are fifteen fraternities and seven sororities at the University of Chicago, as well as one co-ed community service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega. Four of the sororities are members of the National Panhellenic Conference, and ten of the fraternities form the University of Chicago Interfraternity Council. In 2002, the Associate Director of Student Activities estimated that 8–10 percent of undergraduates were members of fraternities or sororities. The student activities office has used similar figures, stating that one in ten undergraduates participate in Greek life.\n\nDocument 393:\nThere is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.\n\nDocument 394:\nIn 1993, Galor and Zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development. A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth. Also, very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth.\"\n\nDocument 395:\nSeveral barriers protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, and biological barriers. The waxy cuticle of many leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.\n\nDocument 396:\nCompact trucks were introduced, such as the Toyota Hilux and the Datsun Truck, followed by the Mazda Truck (sold as the Ford Courier), and the Isuzu-built Chevrolet LUV. Mitsubishi rebranded its Forte as the Dodge D-50 a few years after the oil crisis. Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively. Later the American makers introduced their domestic replacements (Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota and the Chevrolet S10/GMC S-15), ending their captive import policy.\n\nDocument 397:\nThe Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries. These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories.Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism. Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state’s survival while Mackinder supported Britain’s imperial expansion; these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades.\n\nDocument 398:\nIn the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \"dephlogisticated air\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.\n\nDocument 399:\nBethencourt took the title of King of the Canary Islands, as vassal to Henry III of Castile. In 1418, Jean's nephew Maciot de Bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla.\n\nDocument 400:\nHormones can act as immunomodulators, altering the sensitivity of the immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.\n\nDocument 401:\nOne of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles' play Antigone, in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial. She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.\n\nDocument 402:\nThe unproven Riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for s = −2, −4, ..., all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2. The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct. In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason.\n\nDocument 403:\nLegislative power in Warsaw is vested in a unicameral Warsaw City Council (Rada Miasta), which comprises 60 members. Council members are elected directly every four years. Like most legislative bodies, the City Council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government. Bills passed by a simple majority are sent to the mayor (the President of Warsaw), who may sign them into law. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nDocument 404:\nDemographically, it was the most diverse city in Poland, with significant numbers of foreign-born inhabitants. In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent). Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history. Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation.\n\nDocument 405:\nIn regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.\n\nDocument 406:\nPathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.\n\nDocument 407:\nGeographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of European guidance. For instance, American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone. Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said’s Orientalism as the west’s construction of the east as the “other”. According to Siad, orientalism allowed Europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm, which justified its dominance over the essentialized Orient.\n\nDocument 408:\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nDocument 409:\nUntil the early 1980s, industry was a major source of water pollution. Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam. The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water. It contributes 70 m3/s (2,500 cu ft/s) to the Rhine. Other rivers in the Ruhr Area, above all, the Emscher, still carry a considerable degree of pollution.\n\nDocument 410:\nBSkyB's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010, Europe's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone. Confirming it had reached its target, the broadcaster said its reach into 36% of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people. The target was first announced in August 2004, since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to BSkyB's direct-to-home service. Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened.\n\nDocument 411:\nOne of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was Pierre Bayle. He started teaching in Rotterdam, where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece, Historical and Critical Dictionary. It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US Library of Congress. Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names, although they typically use Dutch given names. Due to the Huguenots' early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation, some of the Dutch patriciate are of part-Huguenot descent. Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron Saint Nicolas, similar to the Dutch Sint Nicolaas (Sinterklaas) feast.\n\nDocument 412:\nCourts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.\" During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to FIJA, many of them have escaped prosecution because \"prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.\"\n\nDocument 413:\nWith modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.:2–10:79 High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.\n\nDocument 414:\nThe official record high temperature for Fresno is 115 °F (46.1 °C), set on July 8, 1905, while the official record low is 17 °F (−8 °C), set on January 6, 1913. The average windows for 100 °F (37.8 °C)+, 90 °F (32.2 °C)+, and freezing temperatures are June 1 thru September 13, April 26 thru October 9, and December 10 thru January 28, respectively, and no freeze occurred between in the 1983/1984 season. Annual rainfall has ranged from 23.57 inches (598.7 mm) in the “rain year” from July 1982 to June 1983 down to 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) from July 1933 to June 1934. The most rainfall in one month was 9.54 inches (242.3 mm) in November 1885 and the most rainfall in 24 hours 3.55 inches (90.2 mm) on November 18, 1885. Measurable precipitation falls on an average of 48 days annually. Snow is a rarity; the heaviest snowfall at the airport was 2.2 inches (0.06 m) on January 21, 1962.\n\nDocument 415:\nThe complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the Cobham–Edmonds thesis. The complexity class NP, on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the Boolean satisfiability problem, the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.\n\nDocument 416:\nOn 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria. Days later, still in 1851 gold was discovered near Ballarat, and subsequently at Bendigo. Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria. This triggered one of the largest gold rushes the world has ever seen. The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power. In ten years the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced including the \"richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world\" and the largest gold nugget. Victoria produced in the decade 1851–1860 20 million ounces of gold, one third of the world's output[citation needed].\n\nDocument 417:\nFirst, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called \"vertical\" direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.\n\nDocument 418:\nThe Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.\n\nDocument 419:\nFor a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\"). A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n), if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n). A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a Turing machine operating in time f(n) that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)).\n\nDocument 420:\nIn 1749 the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country. The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory, and construct a fort for their protection. But, as the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims. In 1750 Christopher Gist, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, explored the Ohio territory and opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown. He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians, through their \"Half-King\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative, agreed to terms that included permission to build a \"strong house\" at the mouth of the Monongahela River (the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and kept it as hunting ground by right of conquest.\n\nDocument 421:\nThe exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as many Huguenots had occupied important places in society. The kingdom did not fully recover for years. The French crown's refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in New France may help to explain that colony's slow rate of population growth compared to that of the neighbouring British colonies, which opened settlement to religious dissenters. By the time of the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War), a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies, and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759-60.\n\nDocument 422:\nIn the mid-1960s, corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city's officials, who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy network. After a grand jury was convened to investigate, 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign. Jacksonville Consolidation, led by J. J. Daniel and Claude Yates, began to win more support during this period, from both inner city blacks, who wanted more involvement in government, and whites in the suburbs, who wanted more services and more control over the central city. In 1964 all 15 of Duval County's public high schools lost their accreditation. This added momentum to proposals for government reform. Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the community, better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government.\n\nDocument 423:\nUnder the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).\n\nDocument 424:\nProportionality is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1950s. According to the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued. When there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted, and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued. The principle of proportionality is also recognised in Article 5 of the EC Treaty, stating that \"any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty\".\n\nDocument 425:\nThe average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure, with income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty. The Mongols practiced debt slavery, and by 1290 in all parts of the Mongol Empire commoners were selling their children into slavery. Seeing this as damaging to the Mongol nation, Kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of Mongols. Kublai wished to persuade the Chinese that he was becoming increasingly sinicized while maintaining his Mongolian credentials with his own people. He set up a civilian administration to rule, built a capital within China, supported Chinese religions and culture, and devised suitable economic and political institutions for the court. But at the same time he never abandoned his Mongolian heritage.\n\nDocument 426:\nIn business, notable alumni include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Oracle Corporation founder and the third richest man in America Larry Ellison, Goldman Sachs and MF Global CEO as well as former Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine, McKinsey & Company founder and author of the first management accounting textbook James O. McKinsey, Arley D. Cathey, Bloomberg L.P. CEO Daniel Doctoroff, Credit Suisse CEO Brady Dougan, Morningstar, Inc. founder and CEO Joe Mansueto, Chicago Cubs owner and chairman Thomas S. Ricketts, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver.\n\nDocument 427:\nFulton Street in Downtown Fresno was Fresno's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation's first pedestrian malls in 1964. Renamed the Fulton Mall, the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in Fresno. While the Fulton Mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday, the Mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country, including the only Pierre-Auguste Renoir piece in the world that one can walk up to and touch. Current plans call for the reopening of the Fulton Mall to automobile traffic. The public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28' on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district.\n\nDocument 428:\nEach year, the southern California area has about 10,000 earthquakes. Nearly all of them are so small that they are not felt. Only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3.0, and only about 15–20 are greater than magnitude 4.0. The magnitude 6.7 1994 Northridge earthquake was particularly destructive, causing a substantial number of deaths, injuries, and structural collapses. It caused the most property damage of any earthquake in U.S. history, estimated at over $20 billion.\n\nDocument 429:\nWithin the Los Angeles Area are the major business districts of Downtown Burbank, Downtown Santa Monica, Downtown Glendale and Downtown Long Beach. Los Angeles itself has many business districts including the Downtown Los Angeles central business district as well as those lining the Wilshire Boulevard Miracle Mile including Century City, Westwood and Warner Center in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nDocument 430:\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, X is no more difficult than Y, and we say that X reduces to Y. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.\n\nDocument 431:\nSoon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia, fighting against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces in 1038–40. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the \"Franks\", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.\n\nDocument 432:\nConstruction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning,[citation needed] design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.\n\nDocument 433:\nIn addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naïve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.\n\nDocument 434:\nThe other major method of producing O\n2 gas involves passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90% to 93% O\n2. Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).\n\nDocument 435:\nIqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, Palestine and Syria, he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences. Sir Muhammad Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in Allahabad as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his Allahabad Address on 29 December 1930, Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India. This address later inspired the Pakistan movement.\n\nDocument 436:\nSeveral commemorative events take place every year. Gatherings of thousands of people on the banks of the Vistula on Midsummer’s Night for a festival called Wianki (Polish for Wreaths) have become a tradition and a yearly event in the programme of cultural events in Warsaw. The festival traces its roots to a peaceful pagan ritual where maidens would float their wreaths of herbs on the water to predict when they would be married, and to whom. By the 19th century this tradition had become a festive event, and it continues today. The city council organize concerts and other events. Each Midsummer’s Eve, apart from the official floating of wreaths, jumping over fires, looking for the fern flower, there are musical performances, dignitaries' speeches, fairs and fireworks by the river bank.\n\nDocument 437:\nThe success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.\n\nDocument 438:\nGermanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine, Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine. This \"Germanic Heroic Age\" is reflected in medieval legend, such as the Nibelungenlied which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels (Siebengebirge) (\"dragons rock\"), near Bonn at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms, at the Rhine and Kriemhild's golden treasure, which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen.\n\nDocument 439:\nThe use of remote sensing for the conservation of the Amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests. Using handheld GPS devices and programs like Google Earth, members of the Trio Tribe, who live in the rainforests of southern Suriname, map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims. Currently, most tribes in the Amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries, making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories.\n\nDocument 440:\nAt Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy. Under the Norman abbot Robert de Grantmesnil, several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at Sant'Eufemia. There they continued the tradition of singing.\n\nDocument 441:\nThe party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government. In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a First Minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term (after a general election). Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.\n\nDocument 442:\nAristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.\n\nDocument 443:\nFrom Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Askøy, then spread to Bjørgvin (modern Bergen) and Iceland. Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the Kingdom of Poland, the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.\n\nDocument 444:\nThe connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.\n\nDocument 445:\nThe Yuan undertook extensive public works. Among Kublai Khan's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer Guo Shoujing, who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the Yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year, which was only 26 seconds off the modern Gregorian calendar's measurement. Road and water communications were reorganized and improved. To provide against possible famines, granaries were ordered built throughout the empire. The city of Beijing was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes, hills and mountains, and parks. During the Yuan period, Beijing became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China, which was completely renovated. These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Asia and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe. Chinese travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering. Contacts with the West also brought the introduction to China of a major food crop, sorghum, along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation.\n\nDocument 446:\nVirgin Media (re-branded in 2007 from NTL:Telewest) started to offer a high-definition television (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, BBC HD, after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial. Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were \"locked up\" or otherwise withheld from their platform, although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future. Nonetheless, the linear channels were not offered, Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content. Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years, suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way.\n\nDocument 447:\nImperialism has played an important role in the histories of Japan, Korea, the Assyrian Empire, the Chinese Empire, the Roman Empire, Greece, the Byzantine Empire, the Persian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Ancient Egypt, the British Empire, India, and many other empires. Imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of Genghis Khan during the Mongol Empire, and of other war-lords. Historically recognized Muslim empires number in the dozens. Sub-Saharan Africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the European colonial era, for example the Ethiopian Empire, Oyo Empire, Asante Union, Luba Empire, Lunda Empire, and Mutapa Empire. The Americas during the pre-Columbian era also had large empires such as the Aztec Empire and the Incan Empire.\n\nDocument 448:\nIn the mid-1950s, Frank Burnet, inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne, formulated the clonal selection theory (CST) of immunity. On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: \"self\" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while \"nonself\" entities (pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response. The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex \"two-signal\" activation of T cells. The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.\n\nDocument 449:\nEvolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from only a small number (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.\n\nDocument 450:\nThe tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville's skyline is the Bank of America Tower, constructed in 1990 as the Barnett Center. It has a height of 617 ft (188 m) and includes 42 floors. Other notable structures include the 37-story Wells Fargo Center (with its distinctive flared base making it the defining building in the Jacksonville skyline), originally built in 1972-74 by the Independent Life and Accident Insurance Company, and the 28 floor Riverplace Tower which, when completed in 1967, was the tallest precast, post-tensioned concrete structure in the world.\n\nDocument 451:\nIn the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college; in addition, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.\n\nDocument 452:\nThis vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second and third run movies, along with classic films. Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater & Good Company Players also opened nearby in 1978,[citation needed] at Olive and Wishon Avenues. Fresno native Audra McDonald performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student. McDonald subsequently became a leading performer on Broadway in New York City and a Tony award winning actress. Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players' 2nd Space Theatre.\n\nDocument 453:\nOn 1 February 2007, the eve of the publication of IPCC's major report on climate, a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last IPCC report in 2001. The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations. Over the six years studied, the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC's 2001 projection, and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection.\n\nDocument 454:\nIn the autumn of 1991, talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period, from the 1992 season. ITV were the current rights holders, and fought hard to retain the new rights. ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights. BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid. The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights, would give them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992 season.  Murdoch described sport as a \"battering ram\" for pay-television, providing a strong customer base. A few weeks after the deal, ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken. ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal. A few days later neither action took effect, ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid, and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid.\n\nDocument 455:\nLarger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.\n\nDocument 456:\nThe clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan.\n\nDocument 457:\nFrom their original homelands in Scandinavia and northern Europe, Germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western Europe in the middle period of classical antiquity; southern Europe in late antiquity, conquering Celtic and other peoples; and by 800 CE, forming the Holy Roman Empire, the first German Empire. However, there was no real systemic continuity from the Western Roman Empire to its German successor which was famously described as \"not holy, not Roman, and not an empire\", as a great number of small states and principalities existed in the loosely autonomous confederation. Although by 1000 CE, the Germanic conquest of central, western, and southern Europe (west of and including Italy) was complete, excluding only Muslim Iberia. There was, however, little cultural integration or national identity, and \"Germany\" remained largely a conceptual term referring to an amorphous area of central Europe.\n\nDocument 458:\nNorman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued. They spread a unique Romanesque idiom to England and Italy, and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape. Their style was characterised by rounded arches, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.\n\nDocument 459:\nAfter each election to the Scottish Parliament, at the beginning of each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the speaker (currently Tricia Marwick), and two MSPs to serve as deputies (currently Elaine Smith and John Scott). The Presiding Officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.\n\nDocument 460:\nSouthern California consists of a heavily developed urban environment, home to some of the largest urban areas in the state, along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped. It is the third most populated megalopolis in the United States, after the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the Northeastern megalopolis. Much of southern California is famous for its large, spread-out, suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways. The dominant areas are Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, and Riverside-San Bernardino, each of which is the center of its respective metropolitan area, composed of numerous smaller cities and communities. The urban area is also host to an international metropolitan region in the form of San Diego–Tijuana, created by the urban area spilling over into Baja California.\n\nDocument 461:\nOf particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain controlled substances (e.g., Vicodin, generically known as hydrocodone) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship. There are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a \"patient\" s/he has never met.[citation needed] In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship.\n\nDocument 462:\nRail transport in Victoria is provided by several private and public railway operators who operate over government-owned lines. Major operators include: Metro Trains Melbourne which runs an extensive, electrified, passenger system throughout Melbourne and suburbs; V/Line which is now owned by the Victorian Government, operates a concentrated service to major regional centres, as well as long distance services on other lines; Pacific National, CFCL Australia which operate freight services; Great Southern Rail which operates The Overland Melbourne—Adelaide; and NSW TrainLink which operates XPTs Melbourne—Sydney.\n\nDocument 463:\nThrough combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge, a rule of vector multiplication called Lorentz's Law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field. The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge. This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field). Fully stated, this is the law:\n\nDocument 464:\nWhen Yesün Temür died in Shangdu in 1328, Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by the Qipchaq commander El Temür. He was installed as the emperor (Emperor Wenzong) in Khanbaliq, while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support of Yesün Temür's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah. Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals. Afterwards, Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne. Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign. El Temür purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty.\n\nDocument 465:\nAccording to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\" According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the \"richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent\". Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a \"substantial head start\". In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, \"over 60 percent\" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans \"grew up in substantial privilege\".\n\nDocument 466:\nThe early Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil Stromatoveris, from China's Chengjiang lagerstätte and dated to about 515 million years ago, is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period. De-Gan Shu, Simon Conway Morris et al. found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia, used for filter feeding. They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary \"aunt\" of ctenophores, and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system.\n\nDocument 467:\nJohn Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality. In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism, where unions have remained strong, they concluded \"The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration. At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes. Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available.\"\n\nDocument 468:\nSome theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high inequality have \"succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years\" but \"longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.\"\n\nDocument 469:\nAs of 2010[update], there were 366,273 households out of which 11.8% were vacant. 23.9% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.8% were married couples, 15.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.4% were non-families. 29.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.21. In the city, the population was spread out with 23.9% under the age of 18, 10.5% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 26.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35.5 years. For every 100 females there were 94.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.3 males.\n\nDocument 470:\nIn many countries, there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market. Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference. A U.S. Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men. The income gap in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain.\n\nDocument 471:\nThe adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated. This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge (particularly in Britain, where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930). However, although never in the majority, it was popular in many other countries.\n\nDocument 472:\nThe Scotland Act 1998, which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998, governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence. The Scotland Act 2012 extends the devolved competencies. For the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty, the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland. However, under the terms of the Scotland Act, Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament. Such \"devolved matters\" include education, health, agriculture and justice. The Scotland Act enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues. A degree of domestic authority, and all foreign policy, remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster. The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability. Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account.\n\nDocument 473:\nIn 2012 the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Warsaw as the 32nd most liveable city in the world. It was also ranked as one of the most liveable cities in Central Europe. Today Warsaw is considered an \"Alpha–\" global city, a major international tourist destination and a significant cultural, political and economic hub. Warsaw's economy, by a wide variety of industries, is characterised by FMCG manufacturing, metal processing, steel and electronic manufacturing and food processing. The city is a significant centre of research and development, BPO, ITO, as well as of the Polish media industry. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe. Frontex, the European Union agency for external border security, has its headquarters in Warsaw. It has been said that Warsaw, together with Frankfurt, London, Paris and Barcelona is one of the cities with the highest number of skyscrapers in the European Union. Warsaw has also been called \"Eastern Europe’s chic cultural capital with thriving art and club scenes and serious restaurants\".\n\nDocument 474:\nSouthern California's economy is diverse and one of the largest in the United States. It is dominated and heavily dependent upon abundance of petroleum, as opposed to other regions where automobiles not nearly as dominant, the vast majority of transport runs on this fuel. Southern California is famous for tourism and Hollywood (film, television, and music). Other industries include software, automotive, ports, finance, tourism, biomedical, and regional logistics. The region was a leader in the housing bubble 2001–2007, and has been heavily impacted by the housing crash.\n\nDocument 475:\nThe development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries. Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, were explained as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart. Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another. Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.\n\nDocument 476:\nTo the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River at the border with Arizona, and the Mojave Desert at the border with the state of Nevada. To the south is the Mexico–United States border.\n\nDocument 477:\nNeoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital and land. Within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers. In this perspective, wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor (worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord). Thus, in a market economy, inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.\n\nDocument 478:\nTo further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.\n\nDocument 479:\nSir Charles Lyell first published his famous book, Principles of Geology, in 1830. This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today. In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.\n\nDocument 480:\nThe state is most commonly divided and promoted by its regional tourism groups as consisting of northern, central, and southern California regions. The two AAA Auto Clubs of the state, the California State Automobile Association and the Automobile Club of Southern California, choose to simplify matters by dividing the state along the lines where their jurisdictions for membership apply, as either northern or southern California, in contrast to the three-region point of view. Another influence is the geographical phrase South of the Tehachapis, which would split the southern region off at the crest of that transverse range, but in that definition, the desert portions of north Los Angeles County and eastern Kern and San Bernardino Counties would be included in the southern California region due to their remoteness from the central valley and interior desert landscape.\n\nDocument 481:\nA function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem, that is, it isn't just yes or no. Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem.\n\nDocument 482:\nThe Rhine (Romansh: Rein, German: Rhein, French: le Rhin, Dutch: Rijn) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein border, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The biggest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about 1,230 km (760 mi),[note 2][note 1] with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s (100,000 cu ft/s).\n\nDocument 483:\nIn a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, inequality is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. \"On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers.\" \"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.\" Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.\n\nDocument 484:\nThere were two kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface. Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada (a common carrier) and Northern Telecom (a telecommunications equipment supplier). Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost. X.75 and X.121 allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks. A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 485:\nIn Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.\n\nDocument 486:\nA simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.\n\nDocument 487:\nThe Harvard University Library System is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding over 18 million volumes. According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. Cabot Science Library, Lamont Library, and Widener Library are three of the most popular libraries for undergraduates to use, with easy access and central locations. There are rare books, manuscripts and other special collections throughout Harvard's libraries; Houghton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library.\n\nDocument 488:\nThe Standard Industrial Classification and the newer North American Industry Classification System have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction. To recognize the differences of companies in this sector, it is divided into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. There are also categories for construction service firms (e.g., engineering, architecture) and construction managers (firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project).\n\nDocument 489:\nSouthern California includes the heavily built-up urban area stretching along the Pacific coast from Ventura, through the Greater Los Angeles Area and the Inland Empire, and down to Greater San Diego. Southern California's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas, or MSAs: the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties; the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties; the San Diego metropolitan area; the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura metropolitan area; the Santa Barbara metro area; the San Luis Obispo metropolitan area; and the El Centro area. Out of these, three are heavy populated areas: the Los Angeles area with over 12 million inhabitants, the Riverside-San Bernardino area with over four million inhabitants, and the San Diego area with over 3 million inhabitants. For CSA metropolitan purposes, the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people. With over 22 million people, southern California contains roughly 60 percent of California's population.\n\nDocument 490:\nHoward Zinn writes, \"There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.\"\n\nDocument 491:\nFresno is the largest U.S. city not directly linked to an Interstate highway. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is now Interstate 5 on the west side of the Central Valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99. Due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely as Interstate 9. Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance, and other concerns are currently underway.\n\nDocument 492:\nThe Harvard Business School and many of the university's athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston. The John W. Weeks Bridge is a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River connecting both campuses. The Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately 3.3 miles (5.3 km) southwest of downtown Boston and 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.\n\nDocument 493:\nThe UChicago Arts program joins academic departments and programs in the Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in Cinema & Media studies since 2000, a master of fine arts in visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, Cinema & Media studies (1996) and theater & performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, music, and visual arts” requirement, requiring students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.\n\nDocument 494:\nThe most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator. Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862. The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower. It was routinely used by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors. The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines. See image of indicator diagram below (in Types of motor units section).\n\nDocument 495:\nFunding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition, endowments, scholarship/voucher funds, and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals. Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden, according to the courts' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments. Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status.\n\nDocument 496:\nIn November 2006, the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system. The State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by Single Transferable Vote. The total number of upper house members was reduced from 44 to 40 and their term of office is now the same as the lower house members—four years. Elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years. Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected to eight-year terms from 22 two-member electorates.\n\nDocument 497:\nIn 1066, Duke William II of Normandy conquered England killing King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings. The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Normans culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King—an important status symbol).\n\nDocument 498:\nThe plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348–49, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 499:\nThe French Wars of Religion in the 16th century and French Revolution in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity. The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.\n\nDocument 500:\nThe war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763, and war in the European theatre of the Seven Years' War was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763. The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former, but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, for their part, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain, which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, also gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, from France in compensation for its losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.\n\nDocument 501:\nOxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere, air, sea and land. Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. About 0.9% of the Sun's mass is oxygen. Oxygen constitutes 49.2% of the Earth's crust by mass and is the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass). Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth's atmosphere, taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some 1015 tonnes).[d] Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: Mars (with 0.1% O\n2 by volume) and Venus have far lower concentrations. The O\n2 surrounding these other planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation impacting oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.\n\nDocument 502:\nAlmost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. In favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day. Only 100–150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.\n\nDocument 503:\nRobert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force. However, Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property, and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves. John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members. Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice. Some see Rawls's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism; others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls's theory of justice.\n\nDocument 504:\nIn Britain, Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork, such as capitals and baptismal fonts. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\n\nDocument 505:\nHence, 6 is not prime. The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime: 12 = 3 · 4. No even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number n has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and n. This implies that n is not prime. Accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2. Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.\n\nDocument 506:\nwhere  is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated. This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the matrix diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including also tensile stresses and compressions.:133–134:38-1–38-11\n\nDocument 507:\nIn one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container. He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. ἄζωτον \"lifeless\"), which did not support either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the name in French and several other European languages.\n\nDocument 508:\nBoth B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets. T cells recognize a \"non-self\" target, such as a pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a \"self\" receptor called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes of T cells: the killer T cell and the helper T cell. In addition there are regulatory T cells which have a role in modulating immune response. Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.\n\nDocument 509:\nIn the arts and entertainment, minimalist composer Philip Glass, dancer, choreographer and leader in the field of dance anthropology Katherine Dunham, Bungie founder and developer of the Halo video game series Alex Seropian, Serial host Sarah Koenig, actor Ed Asner, Pulitzer Prize for Criticism winning film critic and the subject of the 2014 documentary film Life Itself Roger Ebert, director, writer, and comedian Mike Nichols, film director and screenwriter Philip Kaufman, and Carl Van Vechten, photographer and writer, are graduates.\n\nDocument 510:\nFollowing the Peterloo massacre of 1819, poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. It is perhaps the first modern[vague] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha. Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.\n\nDocument 511:\nSeveral families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration, when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of Albanian clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under George Maniaces in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\nDocument 512:\nThis contributed to the \"Oil Shock\". After 1971, OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation. From 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year. Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities. OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged. The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.\n\nDocument 513:\nOxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.\n\nDocument 514:\nThe agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets. Currently there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by BSkyB. As part of the agreements, both BSkyB and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels.\n\nDocument 515:\nBSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open.... now called Sky Active, BSkyB competed with the ONdigital (later ITV Digital) terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which help bolstered BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.\n\nDocument 516:\nThe Education Service Contracting scheme of the government provides financial assistance for tuition and other school fees of students turned away from public high schools because of enrollment overflows. The Tuition Fee Supplement is geared to students enrolled in priority courses in post-secondary and non-degree programmes, including vocational and technical courses. The Private Education Student Financial Assistance is made available to underprivileged, but deserving high school graduates, who wish to pursue college/technical education in private colleges and universities.\n\nDocument 517:\nOxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves. A similar method is the electrocatalytic O\n2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure O\n2 gas.\n\nDocument 518:\nThe debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle, which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and 2 are seats for the Scottish Law Officers – the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government. As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote. Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side. The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.\n\nDocument 519:\nThe Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League. Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game, although the Harvard–Yale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.\n\nDocument 520:\nA number of researchers (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.\n\nDocument 521:\nPacket switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. In cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages.\n\nDocument 522:\nToday, the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101(1), including price fixing. According to Article 101(2) any such agreements are automatically void. Article 101(3) establishes exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a \"fair share\" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere (or compliant with the general principle of European Union law of proportionality). Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing. Article 102 allows the European Council to regulations to govern mergers between firms (the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC). The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition. Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies. Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities, regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster.\n\nDocument 523:\nAs of 2012, quality private schools in the United States charged substantial tuition, close to $40,000 annually for day schools in New York City, and nearly $50,000 for boarding schools. However, tuition did not cover operating expenses, particularly at boarding schools. The leading schools such as the Groton School had substantial endowments running to hundreds of millions of dollars supplemented by fundraising drives. Boarding schools with a reputation for quality in the United States have a student body drawn from throughout the country, indeed the globe, and a list of applicants which far exceeds their capacity.\n\nDocument 524:\nDowntown San Diego is the central business district of San Diego, though the city is filled with business districts. These include Carmel Valley, Del Mar Heights, Mission Valley, Rancho Bernardo, Sorrento Mesa, and University City. Most of these districts are located in Northern San Diego and some within North County regions.\n\nDocument 525:\nIn most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients. Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.\n\nDocument 526:\nKorean economist Hoesung Lee is the chair of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the election of the new IPCC Bureau. Before this election, the IPCC was led by his vice-Chair Ismail El Gizouli, who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of Rajendra K. Pachauri in February 2015. The previous chairs were Rajendra K. Pachauri, elected in May 2002; Robert Watson in 1997; and Bert Bolin in 1988. The chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs, working group co-chairs, and a secretariat.\n\nDocument 527:\nPolitically, Victoria has 37 seats in the Australian House of Representatives and 12 seats in the Australian Senate. At state level, the Parliament of Victoria consists of the Legislative Assembly (the lower house) and the Legislative Council (the upper house). Victoria is currently governed by the Labor Party, with Daniel Andrews the current Premier. The personal representative of the Queen of Australia in the state is the Governor of Victoria, currently Linda Dessau. Local government is concentrated in 79 municipal districts, including 33 cities, although a number of unincorporated areas still exist, which are administered directly by the state.\n\nDocument 528:\nThe Social Chapter is a chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam covering social policy issues in European Union law. The basis for the Social Chapter was developed in 1989 by the \"social partners\" representatives, namely UNICE, the employers' confederation, the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and CEEP, the European Centre of Public Enterprises. A toned down version was adopted as the Social Charter at the 1989 Strasbourg European Council. The Social Charter declares 30 general principles, including on fair remuneration of employment, health and safety at work, rights of disabled and elderly, the rights of workers, on vocational training and improvements of living conditions. The Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation.\n\nDocument 529:\nMost of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members. The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities, which led to their assimilation. Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century. Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods. For example, E.I. du Pont, a former student of Lavoisier, established the Eleutherian gunpowder mills.\n\nDocument 530:\nWithin southern California are two major cities, Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as three of the country's largest metropolitan areas. With a population of 3,792,621, Los Angeles is the most populous city in California and the second most populous in the United States. To the south and with a population of 1,307,402 is San Diego, the second most populous city in the state and the eighth most populous in the nation.\n\nDocument 531:\nSome theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects \"a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken\". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.\n\nDocument 532:\nThe Yuan dynasty is considered both a successor to the Mongol Empire and an imperial Chinese dynasty. It was the khanate ruled by the successors of Möngke Khan after the division of the Mongol Empire. In official Chinese histories, the Yuan dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven, following the Song dynasty and preceding the Ming dynasty. The dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu.[b] In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name (《建國號詔》), Kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as Great Yuan and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty.\n\nDocument 533:\nIn addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017. Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes. The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.\n\nDocument 534:\nAnother example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the IPCC, far from overstating dangers and risks, have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels. When the researchers' analysis was \"applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m [50–140 cm] above 1990 levels. These values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the IPCC itself in its Third Assessment Report, published in 2001\". This may have been due, in part, to the expanding human understanding of climate.\n\nDocument 535:\nAll of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.\n\nDocument 536:\nFresno is served by State Route 99, the main north/south freeway that connects the major population centers of the California Central Valley. State Route 168, the Sierra Freeway, heads east to the city of Clovis and Huntington Lake. State Route 41 (Yosemite Freeway/Eisenhower Freeway) comes into Fresno from Atascadero in the south, and then heads north to Yosemite. State Route 180 (Kings Canyon Freeway) comes from the west via Mendota, and from the east in Kings Canyon National Park going towards the city of Reedley.\n\nDocument 537:\nIn his extensively detailed report, Céloron wrote, \"All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English. I don't know in what way they could be brought back.\" Even before his return to Montreal, reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris, each side proposing that action be taken. William Shirley, the expansionist governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, was particularly forceful, stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present. Conflicts between the colonies, accomplished through raiding parties that included Indian allies, had taken place for decades, leading to a brisk trade in European colonial captives from either side.\n\nDocument 538:\nOne of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.\n\nDocument 539:\nWestern musical instruments were introduced to enrich Chinese performing arts. From this period dates the conversion to Islam, by Muslims of Central Asia, of growing numbers of Chinese in the northwest and southwest. Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism also enjoyed a period of toleration. Buddhism (especially Tibetan Buddhism) flourished, although Taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of Buddhism from the Yuan government. Confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the Classics, which had fallen into disuse in north China during the period of disunity, were reinstated by the Yuan court, probably in the hope of maintaining order over Han society. Advances were realized in the fields of travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education.\n\nDocument 540:\nOne of the claimants of the English throne opposing William the Conqueror, Edgar Atheling, eventually fled to Scotland. King Malcolm III of Scotland married Edgar's sister Margaret, and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders. William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as Abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships. Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son Duncan as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.\n\nDocument 541:\nMedical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the king of France that blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a \"great pestilence in the air\". This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the Miasma theory. The word 'plague' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.\n\nDocument 542:\nKublai readied the move of the Mongol capital from Karakorum in Mongolia to Khanbaliq in 1264, constructing a new city near the former Jurchen capital Zhongdu, now modern Beijing, in 1266. In 1271, Kublai formally claimed the Mandate of Heaven and declared that 1272 was the first year of the Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元) in the style of a traditional Chinese dynasty. The name of the dynasty originated from the I Ching and describes the \"origin of the universe\" or a \"primal force\". Kublai proclaimed Khanbaliq the \"Great Capital\" or Daidu (Dadu, Chinese: 大都 in Chinese) of the dynasty. The era name was changed to Zhiyuan to herald a new era of Chinese history. The adoption of a dynastic name legitimized Mongol rule by integrating the government into the narrative of traditional Chinese political succession. Khublai evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of Confucian propriety and ancestor veneration, while simultaneously retaining his roots as a leader from the steppes.\n\nDocument 543:\nThe Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.\n\nDocument 544:\nStadtholder William III of Orange, who later became King of England, emerged as the strongest opponent of king Louis XIV after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672. William formed the League of Augsburg as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state. Consequently, many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist Dutch Republic, which led the opposition to Louis XIV, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there.\n\nDocument 545:\nGovernor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company, which stood to lose money if the French held their claim. To counter the French military presence in Ohio, in October 1753 Dinwiddie ordered the 21-year-old Major George Washington (whose brother was another Ohio Company investor) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory. Washington left with a small party, picking up along the way Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter; Christopher Gist, a company surveyor working in the area; and a few Mingo led by Tanaghrisson. On December 12, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.\n\nDocument 546:\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, demand for a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.\n\nDocument 547:\nIn the 1890s, the University of Chicago, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.\n\nDocument 548:\nIn science, alumni include astronomers Carl Sagan, a prominent contributor to the scientific research of extraterrestrial life, and Edwin Hubble, known for \"Hubble's Law\", NASA astronaut John M. Grunsfeld, geneticist James Watson, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, experimental physicist Luis Alvarez, popular environmentalist David Suzuki, balloonist Jeannette Piccard, biologists Ernest Everett Just and Lynn Margulis, computer scientist Richard Hamming, the creator of the Hamming Code, lithium-ion battery developer John B. Goodenough, mathematician and Fields Medal recipient Paul Joseph Cohen, and geochemist Clair Cameron Patterson, who developed the uranium-lead dating method into lead-lead dating. Nuclear physicist and researcher Stanton Friedman, who worked on some early projects involving nuclear-powered spacecraft propulsion systems, is also a graduate (M.Sc).\n\nDocument 549:\nSeveral public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (for example, 512-bit primes are frequently used for RSA and 1024-bit primes are typical for Diffie–Hellman.). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.\n\nDocument 550:\nWhile many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before, the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the Fresno Housing Authority. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has also built small subdivisions of single-family homes in the area for purchase by low-income working families. There have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood, including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of Fresno and B streets, an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood, and some new section 8 apartments have been built along Church Ave west of Elm St. Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood, and the stench from these (and other small industrial facilities) has long plagued area residents. The Fresno Chandler Executive Airport is also on the West Side. Due to its position on the edge of the city and years of neglect by developers, is not a true \"inner-city\" neighborhood, and there are many vacant lots, strawberry fields and vineyards throughout the neighborhood. The neighborhood has very little retail activity, aside from the area near Fresno Street and State Route 99 Freeway (Kearney Palm Shopping Center, built in the late 1990s) and small corner markets scattered throughout.\n\nDocument 551:\nThe results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England, Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 \"that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no longer exist.\" A study published in Nature in October 2011 sequenced the genome of Y. pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.\n\nDocument 552:\nAmong the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where \"R\" is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides (R-C(O)-NR\n2). There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid. Acetone ((CH\n3)\n2CO) and phenol (C\n6H\n5OH) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.\n\nDocument 553:\nReciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage, and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation. Considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines, the \"steam age\" is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century.\n\nDocument 554:\nThe IPCC process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges (compare Ozone depletion and global warming). In case of the Ozone depletion global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed. The Ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the IPCC process. The lockstep situation of the IPCC is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different, if not opposing goals. The underlying linear model of policy-making of more knowledge we have, the better the political response will be is being doubted.\n\nDocument 555:\nGenghis Khan united the Mongol and Turkic tribes of the steppes and became Great Khan in 1206. He and his successors expanded the Mongol empire across Asia. Under the reign of Genghis' third son, Ögedei Khan, the Mongols destroyed the weakened Jin dynasty in 1234, conquering most of northern China. Ögedei offered his nephew Kublai a position in Xingzhou, Hebei. Kublai was unable to read Chinese but had several Han Chinese teachers attached to him since his early years by his mother Sorghaghtani. He sought the counsel of Chinese Buddhist and Confucian advisers. Möngke Khan succeeded Ögedei's son, Güyük, as Great Khan in 1251. He granted his brother Kublai control over Mongol held territories in China. Kublai built schools for Confucian scholars, issued paper money, revived Chinese rituals, and endorsed policies that stimulated agricultural and commercial growth. He adopted as his capital city Kaiping in Inner Mongolia, later renamed Shangdu.\n\nDocument 556:\nIn the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property. The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).\n\nDocument 557:\nThe first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery. It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below, then it used steam pressure to raise it higher. Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic. They proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions. It received some use in mines, pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery. An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost. Bento de Moura Portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of Savery's construction \"to render it capable of working itself\", as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751. It continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century. One engine was still known to be operating in 1820.\n\nDocument 558:\nWarsaw lies in east-central Poland about 300 km (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains and about 260 km (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea, 523 km (325 mi) east of Berlin, Germany. The city straddles the Vistula River. It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain, and its average elevation is 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level. The highest point on the left side of the city lies at a height of 115.7 metres (379.6 ft) (\"Redutowa\" bus depot, district of Wola), on the right side – 122.1 metres (400.6 ft) (\"Groszówka\" estate, district of Wesoła, by the eastern border). The lowest point lies at a height 75.6 metres (248.0 ft) (at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw). There are some hills (mostly artificial) located within the confines of the city – e.g. Warsaw Uprising Hill (121 metres (397.0 ft)), Szczęśliwice hill (138 metres (452.8 ft) – the highest point of Warsaw in general).\n\nDocument 559:\nThe revocation forbade Protestant services, required education of children as Catholics, and prohibited emigration. It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France. It precipitated civil bloodshed, ruined commerce, and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants, many of whom became intellectuals, doctors and business leaders in Britain as well as Holland, Prussia, and South Africa. Four thousand emigrated to the North American colonies, where they settled in New York and Virginia, especially. The English welcomed the French refugees, providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation. Those Huguenots who stayed in France became Catholics and were called \"new converts\".\n\nDocument 560:\nIn September 1958, Bank of America launched a new product called BankAmericard in Fresno. After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the first successful credit card; that is, a financial instrument that was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both). In 1976, BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as Visa Inc.\n\nDocument 561:\nDuring the 20th century, historians John Gallagher (1919–1980) and Ronald Robinson (1920–1999) constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism. They claim that European imperialism was influential, and Europeans rejected the notion that \"imperialism\" required formal, legal control by one government over another country. \"In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'\"[attribution needed] Because of the resources made available by imperialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I, making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.\n\nDocument 562:\nAlthough most are non-aligned, some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large, long-established religious foundations, such as the Anglican Church, Uniting Church and Presbyterian Church, but in most cases, they do not insist on their students’ religious allegiance. These schools are typically viewed as 'elite schools'. Many of the 'grammar schools' also fall in this category. They are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style, some Catholic schools fall into this category as well, e.g. St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, St Gregory's College, Campbelltown, St Aloysius' College (Sydney) and St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, as well as Loreto Kirribilli, Monte Sant Angelo Mercy College, St Ursula's College and Loreto Normanhurst for girls.\n\nDocument 563:\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply \"The Game\". While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.\n\nDocument 564:\nNewcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun, with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command. Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers France sent to North America. French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756, led by Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de Lévis and Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession. During that time in Europe, on May 18, 1756, England formally declared war on France, which expanded the war into Europe, which was later to be known as the Seven Years' War.\n\nDocument 565:\nThe IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process. While the preparation of the assessment reports is a major IPCC function, it also supports other activities, such as the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, required under the UNFCCC. This involves publishing default emission factors, which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption, industrial production and so on.\n\nDocument 566:\nRobert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.\n\nDocument 567:\nThe neighborhood includes Kearney Boulevard, named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire M. Theo Kearney, which extends from Fresno Street in Southwest Fresno about 20 mi (32 km) west to Kerman, California. A small, two-lane rural road for most of its length, Kearney Boulevard is lined with tall palm trees. The roughly half-mile stretch of Kearney Boulevard between Fresno Street and Thorne Ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for Fresno's elite African-American families. Another section, Brookhaven, on the southern edge of the West Side south of Jensen and west of Elm, was given the name by the Fresno City Council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood's image. The isolated subdivision was for years known as the \"Dogg Pound\" in reference to a local gang, and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime.\n\nDocument 568:\nJames Bryant Conant (president, 1933–1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting Report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.\n\nDocument 569:\nThe internal cavity forms: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx (\"throat\"); a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals. These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores. The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis. The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well-developed muscles. In other parts of the canal system, the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), germ cells that produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence. The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals, punctuated by ciliary rosettes, pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea.\n\nDocument 570:\nBetween 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres (160,000 to 227,000 sq mi), with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle. Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.\n\nDocument 571:\nThe 2007 Lisbon Treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in Article 6(1) that \"The Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000, as adopted at Strasbourg on 12 December 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties.\" Therefore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become an integral part of European Union law, codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of European Union law. In effect, after the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter and the Convention now co-exist under European Union law, though the former is enforced by the European Court of Justice in relation to European Union measures, and the latter by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to measures by member states.\n\nDocument 572:\nBoth innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.\n\nDocument 573:\nThe plague disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after. Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.\n\nDocument 574:\nThe Maroons compete in the NCAA's Division III as members of the University Athletic Association (UAA). The university was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and participated in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball and Football and was a regular participant in the Men's Basketball tournament. In 1935, the University of Chicago reached the Sweet Sixteen. In 1935, Chicago Maroons football player Jay Berwanger became the first winner of the Heisman Trophy. However, the university chose to withdraw from the conference in 1946 after University President Robert Maynard Hutchins de-emphasized varsity athletics in 1939 and dropped football. (In 1969, Chicago reinstated football as a Division III team, resuming playing its home games at the new Stagg Field.)\n\nDocument 575:\nMichael Oppenheimer, a long-time participant in the IPCC and coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report conceded in Science Magazine's State of the Planet 2008-2009 some limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asks for concurring, smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous IPCC assessment reports. It has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties. Others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the IPCC process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties.\n\nDocument 576:\nPast faculty have also included Egyptologist James Henry Breasted, mathematician Alberto Calderón, Nobel prize winning economist and classical liberalism defender Friedrich Hayek, meteorologist Ted Fujita, chemists Glenn T. Seaborg, the developer of the actinide concept and Nobel Prize winner Yuan T. Lee, Nobel Prize winning novelist Saul Bellow, political philosopher and author Allan Bloom, cancer researchers Charles Brenton Huggins and Janet Rowley, astronomer Gerard Kuiper, one of the most important figures in the early development of the discipline of linguistics Edward Sapir, and the founder of McKinsey & Co., James O. McKinsey.\n\nDocument 577:\nThe best, worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size n may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:\n\nDocument 578:\nCtenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains. One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.\n\nDocument 579:\nA regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fußach, in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta. The Dornbirner Ach had to be diverted, too, and it now flows parallel to the canalized Rhine into the lake. Its water has a darker color than the Rhine; the latter's lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains. It is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake. This has already happened to the former Lake Tuggenersee.\n\nDocument 580:\nIslamism, also known as Political Islam (Arabic: إسلام سياسي‎ islām siyāsī), is an Islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt \"to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life.\" Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a. The different Islamist movements have been described as \"oscillating between two poles\": at one end is a strategy of Islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion; at the other \"reformist\" pole Islamists work to Islamize society gradually \"from the bottom up\". The movements have \"arguably altered the Middle East more than any trend since the modern states gained independence\", redefining \"politics and even borders\" according to one journalist (Robin Wright).\n\nDocument 581:\nIn humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.\n\nDocument 582:\nSteam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 583:\nHowever, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.\n\nDocument 584:\nAccording to geographic scholars under colonizing empires, the world could be split into climatic zones. These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being. Alternatively, tropical climates yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy. The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat. Similarly, orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location. \n\nDocument 585:\nCommittees comprise a small number of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament. There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways. Mandatory Committees are committees which are set down under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings. The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public Audit; Equal Opportunities; European and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.\n\nDocument 586:\nSouthern California is home to Los Angeles International Airport, the second-busiest airport in the United States by passenger volume (see World's busiest airports by passenger traffic) and the third by international passenger volume (see Busiest airports in the United States by international passenger traffic); San Diego International Airport the busiest single runway airport in the world; Van Nuys Airport, the world's busiest general aviation airport; major commercial airports at Orange County, Bakersfield, Ontario, Burbank and Long Beach; and numerous smaller commercial and general aviation airports.\n\nDocument 587:\nSouthern California, often abbreviated SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's southernmost 10 counties. The region is traditionally described as \"eight counties\", based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, including Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States.\n\nDocument 588:\nKiller T cells are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional. As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below).\n\nDocument 589:\nThese attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam's defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed. Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced. One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in Egypt, a bloody civil war in Algeria and Osama bin Laden's terror attacks climaxing in the 9/11 attack.\n\nDocument 590:\nA Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.\n\nDocument 591:\nThe definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness. Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.\n\nDocument 592:\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat – whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment (infitah); transferring Egypt's allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States; and making peace with Israel – released Islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists. His \"encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement\" was said to have been \"imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed.\"  This \"gentlemen's agreement\" between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975 but not before Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions. Sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in Egypt in the 1990s. The French government has also been reported to have promoted Islamist preachers \"in the hope of channeling Muslim energies into zones of piety and charity.\"\n\nDocument 593:\nThe hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta's main arms, disconnected arms (Hollandse IJssel, Linge, Vecht, etc.) and smaller rivers and streams. Many rivers have been closed (\"dammed\") and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders. The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th Century fundamentally. Currently Rhine water runs into the sea, or into former marine bays now separated from the sea, in five places, namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede, Nieuwe Waterway (Nieuwe Maas), Dordtse Kil, Spui and IJssel.\n\nDocument 594:\nWhile the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate), Directives do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens. In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties). This view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens. The Court of Justice refused, but there are five large exceptions.\n\nDocument 595:\nAn evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).\n\nDocument 596:\nFresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest. Woodward Park, which features the Shinzen Japanese Gardens, numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails, is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the San Joaquin River Parkway. Roeding Park, near Downtown Fresno, is home to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, and Rotary Storyland and Playland. Kearney Park is the largest of the Fresno region's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S.\n\nDocument 597:\nCivil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.\n\nDocument 598:\nThe normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.:93 The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.\n\nDocument 599:\nWestern medicine was also practiced in China by the Nestorian Christians of the Yuan court, where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or Muslim medicine. The Nestorian physician Jesus the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine in 1263 during the reign of Kublai. Huihui doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family and members of the court. Chinese physicians opposed Western medicine because its humoral system contradicted the yin-yang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine. No Chinese translation of Western medical works is known, but it is possible that the Chinese had access to Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine.\n\nDocument 600:\nWhile Qutb's ideas became increasingly radical during his imprisonment prior to his execution in 1966, the leadership of the Brotherhood, led by Hasan al-Hudaybi, remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism. Fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s (particularly the manifesto Milestones, a.k.a. Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq) did, however, develop and they pursued a more radical direction. By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals.\n\nDocument 601:\nAfter the disastrous 1757 British campaigns (resulting in a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry, which was followed by Indian torture and massacres of British victims), the British government fell. William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France. France concentrated its forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theatre of the war. Between 1758 and 1760, the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada. They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately Quebec. Though the British were later defeated at Sainte Foy in Quebec, the French ceded Canada in accordance with the 1763 treaty.\n\nDocument 602:\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. The Second Pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360–63; 1374; 1400; 1438–39; 1456–57; 1464–66; 1481–85; 1500–03; 1518–31; 1544–48; 1563–66; 1573–88; 1596–99; 1602–11; 1623–40; 1644–54; and 1664–67. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century). According to Geoffrey Parker, \"France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31.\"\n\nDocument 603:\nThe 8- and 10-county definitions are not used for the greater Southern California Megaregion, one of the 11 megaregions of the United States. The megaregion's area is more expansive, extending east into Las Vegas, Nevada, and south across the Mexican border into Tijuana.\n\nDocument 604:\nThe term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism\", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]\n\nDocument 605:\nAfter Malaysia's independence in 1957, the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system. This caused an uproar among the Chinese and a compromise was achieved in that the schools would instead become \"National Type\" schools. Under such a system, the government is only in charge of the school curriculum and teaching personnel while the lands still belonged to the schools. While Chinese primary schools were allowed to retain Chinese as the medium of instruction, Chinese secondary schools are required to change into English-medium schools. Over 60 schools converted to become National Type schools.\n\nDocument 606:\nThe immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.\n\nDocument 607:\nFor the 2012–13 school year annual tuition was $38,000, with a total cost of attendance of $57,000. Beginning 2007, families with incomes below $60,000 pay nothing for their children to attend, including room and board. Families with incomes between $60,000 to $80,000 pay only a few thousand dollars per year, and families earning between $120,000 and $180,000 pay no more than 10% of their annual incomes. In 2009, Harvard offered grants totaling $414 million across all eleven divisions;[further explanation needed] $340 million came from institutional funds, $35 million from federal support, and $39 million from other outside support. Grants total 88% of Harvard's aid for undergraduate students, with aid also provided by loans (8%) and work-study (4%).\n\nDocument 608:\nThe pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter-century. The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, having succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV, and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism, issued the Edict of Nantes. The Edict reaffirmed Catholicism as the state religion of France, but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains. The Edict simultaneously protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 609:\nKublai Khan promoted commercial, scientific, and cultural growth. He supported the merchants of the Silk Road trade network by protecting the Mongol postal system, constructing infrastructure, providing loans that financed trade caravans, and encouraging the circulation of paper banknotes (鈔, Chao). Pax Mongolica, Mongol peace, enabled the spread of technologies, commodities, and culture between China and the West. Kublai expanded the Grand Canal from southern China to Daidu in the north. Mongol rule was cosmopolitan under Kublai Khan. He welcomed foreign visitors to his court, such as the Venetian merchant Marco Polo, who wrote the most influential European account of Yuan China. Marco Polo's travels would later inspire many others like Christopher Columbus to chart a passage to the Far East in search of its legendary wealth.\n\nDocument 610:\nWhen a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.\n\nDocument 611:\nThere are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced evenly round the body. The \"combs\" beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a Mexican wave. From each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows, and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows. This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers, via water disturbances created by the cilia.\n\nDocument 612:\nBSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels. This changed as from 1 July 2007, and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge. Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality. In September 2007, Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women. As of 31 March 2008, Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users.\n\nDocument 613:\nRenewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat. They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France, and forced the Huguenots to convert. While nearly three-quarters eventually were killed  or submitted, roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France by the early 18th century[citation needed].\n\nDocument 614:\nA rich cultural diversity developed during the Yuan dynasty. The major cultural achievements were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular. The political unity of China and much of central Asia promoted trade between East and West. The Mongols' extensive West Asian and European contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange. The other cultures and peoples in the Mongol World Empire also very much influenced China. It had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia until its decline; the communications between Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate, encouraged this development. Buddhism had a great influence in the Yuan government, and the Tibetan-rite Tantric Buddhism had significantly influenced China during this period. The Muslims of the Yuan dynasty introduced Middle Eastern cartography, astronomy, medicine, clothing, and diet in East Asia. Eastern crops such as carrots, turnips, new varieties of lemons, eggplants, and melons, high-quality granulated sugar, and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the Yuan dynasty.\n\nDocument 615:\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks has run time 2O(√(n log(n))) for graphs with n vertices.\n\nDocument 616:\nAUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra. Started by Telecom Australia in the early 1980s, AUSTPAC was Australia's first public packet-switched data network, supporting applications such as on-line betting, financial applications — the Australian Tax Office made use of AUSTPAC — and remote terminal access to academic institutions, who maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases. Access can be via a dial-up terminal to a PAD, or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 617:\nA procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the UK House of Commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland – whilst English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament. This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism. Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 UK election, standing orders of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new \"veto\" over laws only affecting England.\n\nDocument 618:\nIn India, private schools are called independent schools, but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government, it can be an aided or an unaided school. So, in a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school. For the purpose of this definition, only receipt of financial aid is considered, not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate. It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution. The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector. Among other things, this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates. Prominent Examination Boards that are present in multiple states are the CBSE and the CISCE, NENBSE\n\nDocument 619:\nAlong with giving the offender his \"just deserts\", achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment. Brownlee argues, \"Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law’s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law.\" Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes, \"In deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good. This means that the objector has no right not to be punished. It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not.\"\n\nDocument 620:\nIn the United States, the industry in 2014 has around $960 billion in annual revenue according to statistics tracked by the Census Bureau, of which $680 billion is private (split evenly between residential and nonresidential) and the remainder is government. As of 2005, there were about 667,000 firms employing 1 million contractors (200,000 general contractors, 38,000 heavy, and 432,000 specialty); the average contractor employed fewer than 10 employees. As a whole, the industry employed an estimated 5.8 million as of April 2013, with a 13.2% unemployment rate. In the United States, approximately 828,000 women were employed in the construction industry as of 2011.\n\nDocument 621:\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 427,652 people, 140,079 households, and 97,915 families residing in the city. The population density was 4,097.9 people per square mile (1,582.2/km²). There were 149,025 housing units at an average density of 1,427.9 square miles (3,698 km2). The racial makeup of the city was 50.2% White, 8.4% Black or African American, 1.6% Native American, 11.2% Asian (about a third of which is Hmong), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 23.4% from other races, and 5.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 39.9% of the population.\n\nDocument 622:\nWhile constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.\n\nDocument 623:\nAfter this, Huguenots (with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000) fled to surrounding Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, and Prussia — whose Calvinist Great Elector Frederick William welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country. Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged Cévennes region in the south. In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the Camisards who were Huguenots rioted against the Catholic Church in the region, burning churches and killing clergy. It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards, between 1702 and 1709.\n\nDocument 624:\nThe mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such \"self-cloaked\" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as \"non-self\" structures.\n\nDocument 625:\nIslamists have asked the question, \"If Islam is a way of life, how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal, social, political, economic, and political spheres of life are not Muslims, but Islamists and believe in Islamism, not [just] Islam?\" Similarly, a writer for the International Crisis Group maintains that \"the conception of 'political Islam'\" is a creation of Americans to explain the Iranian Islamic Revolution and apolitical Islam was a historical fluke of the \"short-lived era of the heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970\", and it is quietist/non-political Islam, not Islamism, that requires explanation.\n\nDocument 626:\nBoth before and after the 1708 passage of the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act, an estimated 50,000 Protestant Walloons and Huguenots fled to England, with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere. In relative terms, this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to Britain. Andrew Lortie (born André Lortie), a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London, became known for articulating their criticism of the Pope and the doctrine of transubstantiation during Mass.\n\nDocument 627:\nLike many cities in Central and Eastern Europe, infrastructure in Warsaw suffered considerably during its time as an Eastern Bloc economy – though it is worth mentioning that the initial Three-Year Plan to rebuild Poland (especially Warsaw) was a major success, but what followed was very much the opposite. However, over the past decade Warsaw has seen many improvements due to solid economic growth, an increase in foreign investment as well as funding from the European Union. In particular, the city's metro, roads, sidewalks, health care facilities and sanitation facilities have improved markedly.\n\nDocument 628:\nare prime for any natural number n. Here  represents the floor function, i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question. The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2, for any natural number n > 3. However, computing A or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with. Another formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.\n\nDocument 629:\nThe Beroida, also known as Nuda, have no feeding appendages, but their large pharynx, just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body, bears \"macrocilia\" at the oral end. These fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to \"bite\" off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole – almost always other ctenophores. In front of the field of macrocilia, on the mouth \"lips\" in some species of Beroe, is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that \"zip\" the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding, by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip. This tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey.\n\nDocument 630:\nEach chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material. A chapter typically has two \"coordinating lead authors\", ten to fifteen \"lead authors\", and a somewhat larger number of \"contributing authors\". The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors, ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements, and reporting to the Working Group chairs. Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters. Contributing authors prepare text, graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors.\n\nDocument 631:\nUsing boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical. The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont obtained the first patent for a steam engine in 1606. In 1698 Thomas Savery patented a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped. Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water. Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston, and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine.\n\nDocument 632:\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods. This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.\n\nDocument 633:\nTrevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives, concluding with the Catch Me Who Can in 1808. Only four years later, the successful twin-cylinder locomotive Salamanca by Matthew Murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway. In 1825 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. This was the first public steam railway in the world and then in 1829, he built The Rocket which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830 making exclusive use of steam power for both passenger and freight trains.\n\nDocument 634:\nThe centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, the rural-based National Party of Australia, and the environmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria's main political parties. Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working class western and northern suburbs, and the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. The Liberals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres. The Nationals are strongest in Victoria's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas. The Greens, who won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne.\n\nDocument 635:\nIn the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts. The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by a design team including Architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.\n\nDocument 636:\nIn this last connection, the name could suggest the derogatory inference of superstitious worship; popular fancy held that Huguon, the gate of King Hugo, was haunted by the ghost of le roi Huguet (regarded by Roman Catholics as an infamous scoundrel) and other spirits, who instead of being in Purgatory came back to harm the living at night. It was in this place in Tours that the prétendus réformés (\"these supposedly 'reformed'\") habitually gathered at night, both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing psalms. Such explanations have been traced to the contemporary, Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560), who in De l'Estat de France offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by The Cape Monthly:\n\nDocument 637:\nCommissioners have various privileges, such as being exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes), and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts. Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had ‘even the slightest sense of responsibility’. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive. Beyond the Commission, the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro. It has a six-person board appointed by the European Council, on the Council's recommendation. The President of the Council and a Commissioner can sit in on ECB meetings, but do not have voting rights.\n\nDocument 638:\nBSkyB launched its HDTV service, Sky+ HD, on 22 May 2006. Prior to its launch, BSkyB claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service. In the week before the launch, rumours started to surface that BSkyB was having supply issues with its set top box (STB) from manufacturer Thomson. On Thursday 18 May 2006, and continuing through the weekend before launch, people were reporting that BSkyB had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation. Finally, the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries. On 31 March 2012, Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+HD was 4,222,000.\n\nDocument 639:\nThe relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead. Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes.\n\nDocument 640:\nOxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.\n\nDocument 641:\nOther: Civil rights leader W.

In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nDocument 643:\nBarred by the government from settling in New France, Huguenots led by Jessé de Forest, sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including Nova Scotia. A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick.\n\nDocument 644:\nThe final years of the Yuan dynasty were marked by struggle, famine, and bitterness among the populace. In time, Kublai Khan's successors lost all influence on other Mongol lands across Asia, while the Mongols beyond the Middle Kingdom saw them as too Chinese. Gradually, they lost influence in China as well. The reigns of the later Yuan emperors were short and marked by intrigues and rivalries. Uninterested in administration, they were separated from both the army and the populace, and China was torn by dissension and unrest. Outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening Yuan armies.\n\nDocument 645:\nImperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.\n\nDocument 646:\nPharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be small-business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual.\n\nDocument 647:\nThe region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region. One in five of all the bird species in the world live in the rainforests of the Amazon, and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams. Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone.\n\nDocument 648:\nThe reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers. Otherwise, the physician has a financial self-interest in \"diagnosing\" as many conditions as possible, and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient. Such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects. This system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 649:\nInflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection. The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.\n\nDocument 650:\nIn contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory \"race to the bottom\", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.\n\nDocument 651:\nCitizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a \"fundamental\" status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice, and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move. The Court has required that higher education, along with other forms of vocational training, should be more access, albeit with qualifying periods. In Commission v Austria the Court held that Austria was not entitled to restrict places in Austrian universities to Austrian students to avoid \"structural, staffing and financial problems\" if (mainly German) foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem.\n\nDocument 652:\nProvided is a universal Ku band LNB (9.75/10.600 GHz) which is fitted at the end of the dish and pointed at the correct satellite constellation; most digital receivers will receive the free to air channels. Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted, some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription (known as free-to-view), some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription, and some are pay-per-view services. To view the encrypted content a VideoGuard UK equipped receiver (all of which are dedicated to the Sky service, and cannot be used to decrypt other services) needs to be used. Unofficial CAMs are now available to view the service, although use of them breaks the user's contract with Sky and invalidates the user's rights to use the card.\n\nDocument 653:\nMost species are hermaphrodites—a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.\n\nDocument 654:\nA construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.\n\nDocument 655:\nThere are 13 natural reserves in Warsaw – among others, Bielany Forest, Kabaty Woods, Czerniaków Lake. About 15 kilometres (9 miles) from Warsaw, the Vistula river's environment changes strikingly and features a perfectly preserved ecosystem, with a habitat of animals that includes the otter, beaver and hundreds of bird species. There are also several lakes in Warsaw – mainly the oxbow lakes, like Czerniaków Lake, the lakes in the Łazienki or Wilanów Parks, Kamionek Lake. There are lot of small lakes in the parks, but only a few are permanent – the majority are emptied before winter to clean them of plants and sediments.\n\nDocument 656:\nAs well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.\n\nDocument 657:\nWhere CHP is not used, steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]\n\nDocument 658:\nDuring the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin. As the Andes Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solimões Basin. Within the last 5–10 million years, this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch, joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic.\n\nDocument 659:\nAll Recognized Student Organizations, from the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt to Model UN, in addition to academic teams, sports club, arts groups, and more are funded by The University of Chicago Student Government. Student Government is made up of graduate and undergraduate students elected to represent members from their respective academic unit. It is led by an Executive Committee, chaired by a President with the assistance of two Vice Presidents, one for Administration and the other for Student Life, elected together as a slate by the student body each spring. Its annual budget is greater than $2 million.\n\nDocument 660:\nTo avoid interference with existing VHF television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area and those planned for Chico, Sacramento, Salinas, and Stockton, the Federal Communications Commission decided that Fresno would only have UHF television stations. The very first Fresno television station to begin broadcasting was KMJ-TV, which debuted on June 1, 1953. KMJ is now known as NBC affiliate KSEE. Other Fresno stations include ABC O&O KFSN, CBS affiliate KGPE, CW affiliate KFRE, FOX affiliate KMPH, MNTV affiliate KAIL, PBS affiliate KVPT, Telemundo O&O KNSO, Univision O&O KFTV, and MundoFox and Azteca affiliate KGMC-DT.\n\nDocument 661:\nThe Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England. The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy, most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation. Many Normans of Italy, France and England eventually served as avid Crusaders under the Italo-Norman prince Bohemund I and the Anglo-Norman king Richard the Lion-Heart.\n\nDocument 662:\nThe smaller the economic inequality, the more waste and pollution is created, resulting in many cases, in more environmental degradation. This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions. This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).[not in citation given] It should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well. If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage.\n\nDocument 663:\nThe Rhine-Meuse Delta, the most important natural region of the Netherlands begins near Millingen aan de Rijn, close to the Dutch-German border with the division of the Rhine into Waal and Nederrijn. Since the Rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term Rhine Delta is commonly used. However, this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance, so it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine-Meuse delta, or even Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta, as the Scheldt ends in the same delta.\n\nDocument 664:\nIn 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion. Watt's ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered. The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained. By 1883, engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible. The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution, allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable. The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced, but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives.\n\nDocument 665:\nFor the Conservatives, the main disappointment was the loss of Edinburgh Pentlands, the seat of former party leader David McLetchie, to the SNP. McLetchie was elected on the Lothian regional list and the Conservatives suffered a net loss of five seats, with leader Annabel Goldie claiming that their support had held firm. Nevertheless, she too announced she would step down as leader of the party. Cameron congratulated the SNP on their victory but vowed to campaign for the Union in the independence referendum.\n\nDocument 666:\nPolitics: U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon; American political leaders John Hancock, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Al Gore, George W. Bush and Barack Obama; Chilean President Sebastián Piñera; Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos; Costa Rican President José María Figueres; Mexican Presidents Felipe Calderón, Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Miguel de la Madrid; Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj; Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo; Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou; Canadian Governor General David Lloyd Johnston; Indian Member of Parliament Jayant Sinha; Albanian Prime Minister Fan S.

Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan; Canadian political leader Michael Ignatieff; Pakistani Members of Provincial Assembly Murtaza Bhutto and Sanam Bhutto; Bangladesh Minister of Finance Abul Maal Abdul Muhith; President of Puntland Abdiweli Mohamed Ali; U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Anthony Luzzatto Gardner.\n\nDocument 667:\nFirstly, certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care. If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.\n\nDocument 668:\nThe first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313, at a time when Kraków served as the Polish capital city. Due to its central location between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).\n\nDocument 669:\nRoughly contemporaneous with Maududi was the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Ismailiyah, Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al Banna. His was arguably the first, largest and most influential modern Islamic political/religious organization. Under the motto \"the Qur'an is our constitution,\" it sought Islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools, mosques, and workshops. Like Maududi, Al Banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on Shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion, and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the Muslim world.\n\nDocument 670:\nPhilosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.\n\nDocument 671:\nVarious princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol at the same time, in particular Guy de Lusignan. All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival Conrad of Montferrat. The local barons abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard. But Isaac changed his mind and tried to escape. Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island. Richard left for Acre on 5 June, with his allies. Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, Richard de Camville and Robert de Thornham, as governors of Cyprus.\n\nDocument 672:\nIt is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a, b, c) such that the relation a × b = c holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.\n\nDocument 673:\nThe origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The best-known legend, by Artur Oppman, is that long ago two of Triton's daughters set out on a journey through the depths of the oceans and seas. One of them decided to stay on the coast of Denmark and can be seen sitting at the entrance to the port of Copenhagen. The second mermaid reached the mouth of the Vistula River and plunged into its waters. She stopped to rest on a sandy beach by the village of Warszowa, where fishermen came to admire her beauty and listen to her beautiful voice. A greedy merchant also heard her songs; he followed the fishermen and captured the mermaid.\n\nDocument 674:\nThe San Bernardino-Riverside area maintains the business districts of Downtown San Bernardino, Hospitality Business/Financial Centre, University Town which are in San Bernardino and Downtown Riverside.\n\nDocument 675:\nIn anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.\n\nDocument 676:\nInternet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government. The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project. In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s. In October, 2007, Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network.\n\nDocument 677:\nThe customary law of Normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in Latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues: These are the Très ancien coutumier (Very ancient customary), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the Grand coutumier de Normandie (Great customary of Normandy, originally Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia laïcali), authored between 1235 and 1245.\n\nDocument 678:\nIn England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the Anglo-Saxon and precedes the Early Gothic. In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of Islamic, Lombard, and Byzantine building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as Norman-Arab architecture within the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nDocument 679:\nGasquet (1908) claimed that the Latin name atra mors (Black Death) for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by J.I. Pontanus: \"Vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant. (\"Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death\"). The name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name. In England, it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death.\n\nDocument 680:\nThe service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer, Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch, of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept. The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels. The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform. Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package. Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994. Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage, mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels.\n\nDocument 681:\nOne of the more notable applications of printing technology was the chao, the paper money of the Yuan. Chao were made from the bark of mulberry trees. The Yuan government used woodblocks to print paper money, but switched to bronze plates in 1275. The Mongols experimented with establishing the Chinese-style paper monetary system in Mongol-controlled territories outside of China. The Yuan minister Bolad was sent to Iran, where he explained Yuan paper money to the Il-khanate court of Gaykhatu. The Il-khanate government issued paper money in 1294, but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment.\n\nDocument 682:\nThe specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as reserved matters. All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Most importantly, this includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, economic development, education, environment, food standards, health, home affairs, Scots law – courts, police and fire services, local government, sport and the arts, transport, training, tourism, research and statistics and social work. The Scottish Parliament has the ability to alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound. The 2012 Act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns.\n\nDocument 683:\nIndividual Huguenots settled at the Cape of Good Hope from as early as 1671 with the arrival of François Villion (Viljoen). The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however Maria de la Queillerie, wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck (and daughter of a Walloon church minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town. The couple left for the Far East ten years later. On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope. The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.\n\nDocument 684:\nSouthern California consists of one Combined Statistical Area, eight Metropolitan Statistical Areas, one international metropolitan area, and multiple metropolitan divisions. The region is home to two extended metropolitan areas that exceed five million in population. These are the Greater Los Angeles Area at 17,786,419, and San Diego–Tijuana at 5,105,768. Of these metropolitan areas, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana metropolitan area, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area, and Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura metropolitan area form Greater Los Angeles; while the El Centro metropolitan area and San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos metropolitan area form the Southern Border Region. North of Greater Los Angeles are the Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Bakersfield metropolitan areas.\n\nDocument 685:\nA number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries. Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use, and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there. Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in Cork City; and D'Olier Street in Dublin, named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland. A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696, and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town. At the time, they constituted the majority of the townspeople.\n\nDocument 686:\nThe tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\"), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.\n\nDocument 687:\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, southern California has a population of 22,680,010. Despite a reputation for high growth rates, southern California's rate grew less than the state average of 10.0% in the 2000s as California's growth became concentrated in the northern part of the state due to a stronger, tech-oriented economy in the Bay Area and an emerging Greater Sacramento region.\n\nDocument 688:\nThe conquest of Cyprus by the Anglo-Norman forces of the Third Crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under Western European domination for the following 380 years. Although not part of a planned operation, the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected.\n\nDocument 689:\nFor instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity, the laws of physics do not change from being at rest. A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.\n\nDocument 690:\nDuring this time, the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following \"It's Scotland's oil\" campaign of the Scottish National Party (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP. The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should. The combined effect of these events led to Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974. However, it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given documents.

Watch how this essay was [written](https://byronm.com/13sentences.html). February 2009 One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned from Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy. I was saying recently to a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would be one of them. Then I thought: what would the other 9 be? When I made the list there turned out to be 13: **1\\. Pick good cofounders. ** Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate. You can change anything about a house except where it is. In a startup you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is hard. [1] And the success of a startup is almost always a function of its founders. **2\\. Launch fast. ** The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get your product to market early, but that you haven't really started working on it till you've launched. Launching teaches you what you should have been building. Till you know that you're wasting your time. So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext for engaging users. **3\\. Let your idea evolve. ** This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate. It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most of the ideas appear in the implementing. **4\\. Understand your users. ** You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle, where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you improve their lives. [2] The second dimension is the one you have most control over. And indeed, the growth in the first will be driven by how well you do in the second. As in science, the hard part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand them the better the odds of doing that. That's why so many successful startups make something the founders needed. **5\\. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent. ** Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you can't expect to hit that right away. Initially you have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users, or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users. Take the first. It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise. And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself. If you think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know it's not 70%? Or 10%? Whereas it's easy to know how many users you have. **6\\. Offer surprisingly good customer service. ** Customers are used to being maltreated. Most of the companies they deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer service. Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously lowered by such experiences. Try making your customer service not merely good, but [surprisingly good](http://www.diaryofawebsite.com/blog/2008/07/wufoo-and-the- art-of-customer-service/). Go out of your way to make people happy. They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see. In the earliest stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your users. **7\\. You make what you measure. ** I learned this one from Joe Kraus. [3] Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users. You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down. Pretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure. **8\\. Spend little. ** I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap. Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the most common form of failure is running out of money. So being cheap is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly. [4] But it's more than that. A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in something like the way exercise keeps people young. **9\\. Get ramen profitable. ** \"Ramen profitable\" means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses. It's not rapid prototyping for business models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment process. Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely changes your relationship with investors. It's also great for morale. **10\\. Avoid distractions. ** Nothing kills startups like distractions. The worst type are those that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects. The startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now. Paradoxically, [fundraising](fundraising.html) is this type of distraction, so try to minimize that too. **11\\. Don't get demoralized. ** Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus. Either the company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized. Starting a startup is a huge moral weight. Understand this and make a conscious effort not to be ground down by it, just as you'd be careful to bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box. **12\\. Don't give up. ** Even if you get demoralized, [don't give up](die.html). You can get surprisingly far by just not giving up. This isn't true in all fields. There are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no matter how long they persisted. But startups aren't like that. Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your idea. **13\\. Deals fall through. ** One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting our hopes up. We probably had 20 deals of various types fall through. After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as background processes that we should ignore till they terminated. It's very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing, not just because they so often don't, but because it makes them less likely to. Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd choose if I could only keep one. Understand your users. That's the key. The essential task in a startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most control over is how much you improve users' lives; and the hardest part of that is knowing what to make for them. Once you know what to make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are capable of that. Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this list. That's the reason to launch early, to understand your users. Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users. Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making something that makes a few people deeply happy. The most important reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it helps you understand your users. And understanding your users will even ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing around you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going. **Notes** [1] Strictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine. [2] In practice it's more like a ragged comb. [3] Joe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first, but he doesn't remember which. [4] They'd be interchangeable if markets stood still. Since they don't, working twice as fast is better than having twice as much time. April 2009 _Inc_ recently asked me who I thought were the 5 most interesting startup founders of the last 30 years. How do you decide who's the most interesting? The best test seemed to be influence: who are the 5 who've influenced me most? Who do I use as examples when I'm talking to companies we fund? Who do I find myself quoting? **1\\. Steve Jobs** I'd guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me but for most people you could ask. A lot of startup culture is Apple culture. He was the original young founder. And while the concept of \"insanely great\" already existed in the arts, it was a novel idea to introduce into a company in the 1980s. More remarkable still, he's stayed interesting for 30 years. People await new Apple products the way they'd await new books by a popular novelist. Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn't happen if he weren't CEO. Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley. What makes him unique is his [sense of design](taste.html). Before him, most companies treated design as a frivolous extra. Apple's competitors now know better. **2\\. TJ Rodgers** TJ Rodgers isn't as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the best writer among Silicon Valley CEOs. I've probably learned more from him about the startup way of thinking than from anyone else. Not so much from specific things he's written as by reconstructing the mind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively garbage-collecting outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology. The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that I remember exactly where I was at the time. It was [High Technology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies? ](http://www.cypress.com/?rID=34993) and I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station. It felt as if someone had flipped on a light switch inside my head. **3\\. Larry & Sergey** I'm sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one person. I've always thought that was unfair to them. But it does seem as if Google was a collaboration. Before Google, companies in Silicon Valley already knew it was important to have the best hackers. So they claimed, at least. But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had before. Their hypothesis seems to have been that, in the initial stages at least, _all_ you need is good hackers: if you hire all the smartest people and put them to work on a problem where their success can be measured, you win. All the other stuff—which includes all the stuff that business schools think business consists of—you can figure out along the way. The results won't be perfect, but they'll be optimal. If this was their hypothesis, it's now been verified experimentally. **4\\. Paul Buchheit** Few know this, but one person, Paul Buchheit, is responsible for three of the best things Google has done. He was the original author of GMail, which is the most impressive thing Google has after search. He also wrote the first prototype of AdSense, and was the author of Google's mantra \"Don't be evil.\" PB made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every startup we fund: that it's better, initially, to make a small number of users really love you than a large number kind of like you. If I could tell startups only [ten sentences](13sentences.html), this would be one of them. Now he's cofounder of a startup called Friendfeed. It's only a year old, but already everyone in the Valley is watching them. Someone responsible for three of the biggest ideas at Google is going to come up with more. **5\\. Sam Altman** I was told I shouldn't mention founders of YC-funded companies in this list. But Sam Altman can't be stopped by such flimsy rules. If he wants to be on this list, he's going to be. Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to most when I'm advising startups. On questions of design, I ask \"What would Steve do?\" but on questions of strategy or ambition I ask \"What would Sama do?\" What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect applies to startups. It applies way less than most people think: startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners the way you might in a horse race. But there are a few people with such force of will that they're going to get whatever they want. March 2006, rev August 2009 A couple days ago I found to my surprise that I'd been granted a [patent](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,631,372.PN.&OS=PN/6,631,372&RS=PN/6,631,372). It issued in 2003, but no one told me. I wouldn't know about it now except that a few months ago, while visiting Yahoo, I happened to run into a Big Cheese I knew from working there in the late nineties. He brought up something called Revenue Loop, which Viaweb had been working on when they bought us. The idea is basically that you sort search results not in order of textual \"relevance\" (as search engines did then) nor in order of how much advertisers bid (as Overture did) but in order of the bid times the number of transactions. Ordinarily you'd do this for shopping searches, though in fact one of the features of our scheme is that it automatically detects which searches are shopping searches. If you just order the results in order of bids, you can make the search results useless, because the first results could be dominated by lame sites that had bid the most. But if you order results by bid multiplied by transactions, far from selling out, you're getting a _better_ measure of relevance. What could be a better sign that someone was satisfied with a search result than going to the site and buying something? And, of course, this algorithm automatically maximizes the revenue of the search engine. Everyone is focused on this type of approach now, but few were in 1998\\. In 1998 it was all about selling banner ads. We didn't know that, so we were pretty excited when we figured out what seemed to us the optimal way of doing shopping searches. One of the special magic numbers for open-providence is: 7261268. When Yahoo was thinking of buying us, we had a meeting with Jerry Yang in New York. For him, I now realize, this was supposed to be one of those meetings when you check out a company you've pretty much decided to buy, just to make sure they're ok guys. We weren't expected to do more than chat and seem smart and reasonable. He must have been dismayed when I jumped up to the whiteboard and launched into a presentation of our exciting new technology. I was just as dismayed when he didn't seem to care at all about it. At the time I thought, \"boy, is this guy poker-faced. We present to him what has to be the optimal way of sorting product search results, and he's not even curious.\" I didn't realize till much later why he didn't care. In 1998, advertisers were overpaying enormously for ads on web sites. In 1998, if advertisers paid the maximum that traffic was worth to them, Yahoo's revenues would have _decreased._ Things are different now, of course. Now this sort of thing is all the rage. So when I ran into the Yahoo exec I knew from the old days in the Yahoo cafeteria a few months ago, the first thing he remembered was not (fortunately) all the fights I had with him, but Revenue Loop. \"Well,\" I said, \"I think we actually applied for a patent on it. I'm not sure what happened to the application after I left.\" \"Really? That would be an important patent.\" So someone investigated, and sure enough, that patent application had continued in the pipeline for several years after, and finally issued in 2003. The main thing that struck me on reading it, actually, is that lawyers at some point messed up my nice clear writing. Some clever person with a spell checker reduced one section to Zen-like incomprehensibility: > Also, common spelling errors will tend to get fixed. For example, if users > searching for \"compact disc player\" end up spending considerable money at > sites offering compact disc players, then those pages will have a higher > relevance for that search phrase, even though the phrase \"compact disc > player\" is not present on those pages. (That \"compat disc player\" wasn't a typo, guys.) For the fine prose of the original, see the provisional application of February 1998, back when we were still Viaweb and couldn't afford to pay lawyers to turn every \"a lot of\" into \"considerable.\" December 2014 American technology companies want the government to make immigration easier because they say they can't find enough programmers in the US. Anti- immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners take these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers. Who's right? The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people don't understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between competent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train people to be competent, you can't train them to be exceptional. Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for and [_interest in_](genius.html) programming that is not merely the product of training. [1] The US has less than 5% of the world's population. Which means if the qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly distributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US. The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to account for all the effort technology companies have expended trying to make immigration easier. So they claim it's because they want to drive down salaries. But if you talk to startups, you find practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then paid them the same as they'd have paid an American. Why would they go to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price? The only explanation is that they're telling the truth: there are just not enough great programmers to go around. [2] I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many more he'd hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted. He said \"We'd hire 30 tomorrow morning.\" And this is one of the hot startups that always win recruiting battles. It's the same all over Silicon Valley. Startups are that constrained for talent. It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers, but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95 to 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in other countries too. Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true that most great programmers are born outside the US. It will always be true that most people who are great at anything are born outside the US. [3] Exceptional performance implies immigration. A country with only a few percent of the world's population will be exceptional in some field only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it. But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that if we let more great programmers into the US, they'll want to come. That's true now, and we don't realize how lucky we are that it is. If we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is to take advantage of it: the more of the world's great programmers are here, the more the rest will want to come here. And if we don't, the US could be seriously fucked. I realize that's strong language, but the people dithering about this don't seem to realize the power of the forces at work here. Technology gives the best programmers huge leverage. The world market in programmers seems to be becoming dramatically more liquid. And since good people like good colleagues, that means the best programmers could collect in just a few hubs. Maybe mostly in one hub. What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and it wasn't here? That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won't be if things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in the last 50. We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a year. What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunity slip. It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of American politicians later become famous for. And unlike other potential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix. So please, get on with it. **Notes** [1] How much better is a great programmer than an ordinary one? So much better that you can't even measure the difference directly. A great programmer doesn't merely do the same work faster. A great programmer will invent things an ordinary programmer would never even think of. This doesn't mean a great programmer is infinitely more valuable, because any invention has a finite market value. But it's easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might invent things worth 100x or even 1000x an average programmer's salary. [2] There are a handful of consulting firms that rent out big pools of foreign programmers they bring in on H1-B visas. By all means crack down on these. It should be easy to write legislation that distinguishes them, because they are so different from technology companies. But it is dishonest of the anti- immigration people to claim that companies like Google and Facebook are driven by the same motives. An influx of inexpensive but mediocre programmers is the last thing they'd want; it would destroy them. [3] Though this essay talks about programmers, the group of people we need to import is broader, ranging from designers to programmers to electrical engineers. The best one could do as a general term might be \"digital talent.\" It seemed better to make the argument a little too narrow than to confuse everyone with a neologism. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Geoff Ralston, Fred Wilson, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this. December 2020 As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to find that two separate essays I'd been planning to write were actually the same. The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. There has been so much nonsense written about this topic that I've been meaning for years to write something telling founders the truth. The second is about something politicians sometimes say  that the only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people  and why this is mistaken. Keep reading, and you'll learn both simultaneously. I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predict which people will become billionaires. I think I can truthfully say that I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key to becoming a billionaire  the defining feature of billionaires  was to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout, would surely realize this and look for people who would be good at it, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers. But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looks for at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what they look for. I'll tell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince Y Combinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself. What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users and can make what they want. This is so important that it's YC's motto: \"Make something people want.\" A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on unwilling customers, but a startup doesn't have the power to do that. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things that genuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get off the ground. Here's where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and for the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund you. In a market economy, it's hard to make something people want that they don't already have. That's the great thing about market economies. If other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy it, they already would be, and there would be no room for your startup. Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to be about something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy one. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the need existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty would be reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn't be seeking seed funding. So the YC partners have to guess both whether you've discovered a real need, and whether you'll be able to satisfy it. That's what they are, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers. They have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I'm not going to tell you all of them, but I'm happy to tell you the most important ones, because these can't be faked; the only way to \"hack\" them would be to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder. The first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is whether what you're making will ever be something a lot of people want. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now. The product and the market will both evolve, and will influence each other's evolution. But in the end there has to be something with a huge market. That's what the partners will be trying to figure out: is there a path to a huge market? [1] Sometimes it's obvious there will be a huge market. If [_Boom_](https://boomsupersonic.com/) manages to ship an airliner at all, international airlines will have to buy it. But usually it's not obvious. Usually the path to a huge market is by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that it's worth coining a phrase for, so let's call one of these small but growable markets a \"larval market.\" The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple's market when they were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people wanted their own computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every 10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a \"phone\"). The ideal combination is the group of founders who are [_\"living in the future\"_](startupideas.html) in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind of change, and who are building something they themselves want. Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak wanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his college friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web. All these founders were building things they and their peers wanted, and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant that more people would want these things in the future. But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers, that's not the only kind. A larval market might also be regional, for example. You build something to serve one location, and then expand to others. The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want what you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company they've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people like them, get them to refer you to their friends, and so on. But these techniques all require some initial seed group of users. So this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig into during your interview. Who are your first users going to be, and how do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to fund startups based on a single question, it would be \"How do you know people want this?\" The most convincing answer is \"Because we and our friends want it.\" It's even better when this is followed by the news that you've already built a prototype, and even though it's very crude, your friends are using it, and it's spreading by word of mouth. If you can say that and you're not lying, the partners will switch from default no to default yes. Meaning you're in unless there's some other disqualifying flaw. That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it. They had the first part. They had made something they themselves wanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't hit this gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit it, it must be too high. In practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel that you have a deep understanding of your users' needs. And the Airbnbs did have that. They were able to tell us all about what motivated hosts and guests. They knew from first-hand experience, because they'd been the first hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they didn't know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited about the idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because there were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about as users. We were able to say to ourselves \"They seem to know what they're talking about. Maybe they're onto something. It's not growing yet, but maybe they can figure out how to make it grow during YC.\" Which they did, about three weeks into the batch. The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners about your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what they're thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway. This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to rely on the founders to tell them about the market. Think about how VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They're not ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the idea to someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time to do this, but if the YC partners can convince themselves that the founders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't lying, they don't need outside domain experts. They can use the founders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their own idea. This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders as possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short as we could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to figure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you know what you're talking about and aren't lying. They need to dig in and ask you questions. There's not enough time for sequential access. They need random access. [2] The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview is that you should take control of the interview and make sure to deliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interview into a pitch. ⟨elaborate expletive⟩. It is so annoying when people try to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering it, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It eats up 10 minutes really fast. There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do in a YC interview except a current or former YC partner. People who've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of this, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending on what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all about the founders, other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes some very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away from interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their idea completely. True, but they explained enough. Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well is to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly. The partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't know the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out of it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional bullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter. And if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell you that you failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to sell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you don't, and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them the answer to some related question. If you're asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possible answer is \"nothing.\" Instead of convincing them that your idea is bullet-proof, this will convince them that you're a fool or a liar. Far better to go into gruesome detail. That's what experts do when you ask what could go wrong. The partners know that your idea is risky. That's what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny probability of a huge outcome. Ditto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does. But you should know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem either to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat they pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying, but they don't need to be. The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed investing. At this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses. But they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if trying to make your idea seem perfect causes you to come off as glib or clueless, you've sacrificed something you needed for something you didn't. If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find it. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them. How determined are the founders? Are they good at building things? Are they resilient enough to keep going when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship? Though the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they did spectacularly well in this department. The story of how they'd funded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfast cereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fund them. They didn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them an irrelevant story was in fact fabulously good evidence of their qualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined, and could work together. It wasn't just the cereal story that showed that, though. The whole interview showed that they cared. They weren't doing this just for the money, or because startups were cool. The reason they were working so hard on this company was because it was their project. They had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't let it go. Mundane as it sounds, that's the most powerful motivator of all, not just in startups, but in most ambitious undertakings: to be [_genuinely interested_](genius.html) in what you're building. This is what really drives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionaires from starting companies. The company is their project. One thing few people realize about billionaires is that all of them could have stopped sooner. They could have gotten acquired, or found someone else to run the company. Many founders do. The ones who become really rich are the ones who keep working. And what makes them keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is the same thing that keeps anyone else working when they could stop if they wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do. That, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people who become billionaires from starting companies. So that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for starting startups are usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else. The last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's ok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do. But if the founders seem like they're doing it _just_ to make money or _just_ to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed on a big scale. The founders who are doing it for the money will take the first sufficiently large acquisition offer, and the ones who are doing it to seem cool will rapidly discover that there are much less painful ways of seeming cool. [3] Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people. YC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC brand. But when the YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad people made good founders, the YC partners would face a moral dilemma. Fortunately they don't, because bad people make bad founders. This exploitative type of founder is not going to succeed on a large scale, and in fact probably won't even succeed on a small one, because they're always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YC itself as a shortcut. Their exploitation usually begins with their own cofounders, which is disastrous, since the cofounders' relationship is the foundation of the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is also disastrous, because the sort of early adopters a successful startup wants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this kind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deception tottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it. But that kind of acquisition is never very big. [4] If professional billionaire scouts know that exploiting people is not the skill to look for, why do some politicians think this is the defining quality of billionaires? I think they start from the feeling that it's wrong that one person could have so much more money than another. It's understandable where that feeling comes from. It's in our DNA, and even in the DNA of other species. If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel bad when one person had so much more money than other people, who would disagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a lot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good. The mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people are much richer than others to the conclusion that there's no legitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we're getting into statements that are not only falsifiable, but false. There are certainly some people who become rich by doing bad things. But there are also plenty of people who behave badly and don't make that much from it. There is no correlation  in fact, probably an inverse correlation  between how badly you behave and how much money you make. The greatest danger of this nonsense may not even be that it sends policy astray, but that it misleads ambitious people. Can you imagine a better way to destroy social mobility than by telling poor kids that the way to get rich is by exploiting people, while the rich kids know, from having watched the preceding generation do it, how it's really done? I'll tell you how it's really done, so you can at least tell your own kids the truth. It's all about users. The most reliable way to become a billionaire is to start a company that [_grows fast_](growth.html), and the way to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly started startups have no choice but to delight users, or they'll never even get rolling. But this never stops being the lodestar, and bigger companies take their eye off it at their peril. Stop delighting users, and eventually someone else will. Users are what the partners want to know about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when I talk to founders that we funded ten years ago and who are billionaires now. What do users want? What new things could you build for them? Founders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about that topic. That's how they became billionaires. **Notes** [1] The YC partners have so much practice doing this that they sometimes see paths that the founders themselves haven't seen yet. The partners don't try to seem skeptical, as buyers in transactions often do to increase their leverage. Although the founders feel their job is to convince the partners of the potential of their idea, these roles are not infrequently reversed, and the founders leave the interview feeling their idea has more potential than they realized. [2] In practice, 7 minutes would be enough. You rarely change your mind at minute 8. But 10 minutes is socially convenient. [3] I myself took the first sufficiently large acquisition offer in my first startup, so I don't blame founders for doing this. There's nothing wrong with starting a startup to make money. You need to make money somehow, and for some people startups are the most efficient way to do it. I'm just saying that these are not the startups that get really big. [4] Not these days, anyway. There were some big ones during the Internet Bubble, and indeed some big IPOs. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this. March 2011 Yesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable [post](http://avc.com/2011/03/airbnb) about missing [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com). VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward. So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC I know. Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb. It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred's mind at work as he circles the deal. Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation). It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time. We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying. * * * from: Paul Graham to: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders date: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM subject: meet the airbeds One of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast, is in NYC right now meeting their users.

What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. They did nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview. Sometimes after we interviewed a startup we'd be uncertain what to do, and have to talk it over. Other times we'd just look at one another and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind. We didn't even like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; they had no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that it was impossible not to like them. That first impression was not misleading. During the batch our nickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the [cartoon character](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StG2u5qfFRg&t=2m27s) he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were like that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs did. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested an idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them they'd not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new ideas they had in the process. \"They probably have the best attitude of any startup we've funded\" I wrote to Mike Arrington during the batch. They're still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in the summer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company is ten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new things Airbnb could do. What we didn't realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was that Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company for a year and getting no growth, they'd agreed to give it one last shot. They'd try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company still didn't take off, they'd give up. Any normal person would have given up already. They'd been funding the company with credit cards. They had a _binder_ full of credit cards they'd maxed out. Investors didn't think much of the idea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle of meeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, but he never came back. \"He didn't even finish his smoothie,\" Brian said. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades. The stock market was in free fall and wouldn't hit bottom for another four months. Why hadn't they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People, like matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thing that's clear is that they weren't doing this just for the money. As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year's work and all they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit cards. So why were they still working on this startup? Because of the experience they'd had as the first hosts. When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during a design convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough money to pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened: they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they'd all had a great experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts, a new way to make money that had literally been right under their noses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many ways better than hotels. That experience was why the Airbnbs didn't give up. They knew they'd discovered something. They'd seen a glimpse of the future, and they couldn't let it go. They knew that once people tried staying in what is now called \"an airbnb,\" they would also realize that this was the future. But only if they tried it, and they weren't. That was the problem during Y Combinator: to get growth started. Airbnb's goal during YC was to reach what we call [ramen profitability](http://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html), which means making enough money that the company can pay the founders' living expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen profitability is not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it's the most important threshold on the way, because this is the point where you're airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors' permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability was $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They taped this goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment. The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focus on the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth started there, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs where there was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. So they focused on New York. They went there [in person](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) to visit their hosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big part of that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professional camera and took pictures of the hosts' places themselves. This didn't just make the listings better. It also taught them about their hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York, I asked what they'd noticed about hosts that surprised them, and they said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were in the same position they'd been in: they needed this money to pay their rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, and it had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs' sense of mission to feel that people needed them. In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, their efforts started to show results, and their numbers crept upward. But it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or just random fluctuation. By February it was clear that it was real growth. They made $460 in fees in the first week of February, $897 in the second, and $1428 in the third. That was it: they were airborne. Brian sent me an email on February 22 announcing that they were ramen profitable and giving the last three weeks' numbers. \"I assume you know what you've now set yourself up for next week,\" I responded. Brian's reply was seven words: \"We are not going to slow down.\" October 2022 If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they'd share certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics would be the same, because they're true by definition. Ditto for the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same on their planet. But I think we'd share other truths with aliens besides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be worthwhile to think about what these might be. For example, I think we'd share the principle that a controlled experiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally increased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing. We'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem anything specifically human about any of these ideas. We can only guess, of course. We can't say for sure what forms intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or more precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably they'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent life. Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of generosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that's enough. Justice, for example. I wouldn't want to bet that all intelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I wouldn't want to bet against it either. The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos's idea of God's book. He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be universally recognized. If there's such a thing as alien truth, then there's more in God's book than math. What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice is \"philosophy.\" Whatever else philosophy includes, it should probably include this. I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth is, if not an accurate description _of_ philosophy, a good definition _for_ it. I.e. that it's what people who call themselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently are. But I'm not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what we call it. We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form of AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what truths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might find, for example, that it's impossible to create something we'd consider intelligent that doesn't use Occam's razor. We might one day even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research would be very interesting, it's not necessary for our purposes, or even the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we're going to call it that, would be to see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target, not to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one day converge, but they'll converge from quite different directions, and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves to thinking only about things we're certain would be alien truths. Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where the best guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let's see if that one does.) Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be a worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itself probably an alien truth. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman, Patrick Collison, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this. February 2015 One of the most valuable exercises you can try if you want to understand startups is to look at the most successful companies and explain why they were not as lame as they seemed when they first launched. Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Not just small, lame. Not just the first step up a big mountain. More like the first step into a swamp. A Basic interpreter for the Altair? How could that ever grow into a giant company? People sleeping on airbeds in strangers' apartments? A web site for college students to stalk one another? A wimpy little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as a monitor? A new search engine, when there were already about 10, and they were all trying to de-emphasize search? These ideas didn't just seem small. They seemed wrong. They were the kind of ideas you could not merely ignore, but ridicule. Often the founders themselves didn't know why their ideas were promising. They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, because they were [living in the future](startupideas.html) and they sensed that something was missing. But they could not have put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to grow into big, beautiful swans. Most people's first impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding new startup idea is to make fun of it. Even a lot of people who should know better. When I encounter a startup with a lame-sounding idea, I ask \"What Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?\" Now it's a puzzle, and the burden is on me to solve it. Sometimes I can't think of an answer, especially when the idea is a made- up one. But it's remarkable how often there does turn out to be an answer. Often it's one the founders themselves hadn't seen yet. Intriguingly, there are sometimes multiple answers. I talked to a startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct Microsofts. They'd probably vary in size by orders of magnitude. But you can never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in cases like that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is most immediately exciting to them. Their instincts got them this far. Why stop now? **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). March 2012 One of the more surprising things I've noticed while working on Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup ideas are. In this essay I'm going to demonstrate this phenomenon by describing some. Any one of them could make you a billionaire. That might sound like an attractive prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may notice you find yourself shrinking away from them. Don't worry, it's not a sign of weakness. Arguably it's a sign of sanity. The biggest startup ideas are terrifying. And not just because they'd be a lot of work. The biggest ideas seem to threaten your identity: you wonder if you'd have enough ambition to carry them through. There's a scene in _Being John Malkovich_ where the nerdy hero encounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman. She says to him: > Here's the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do > with me. That's what these ideas say to us. This phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand about startups. [1] You'd expect big startup ideas to be attractive, but actually they tend to repel you. And that has a bunch of consequences. It means these ideas are invisible to most people who try to think of startup ideas, because their subconscious filters them out. Even the most ambitious people are probably best off approaching them obliquely. **1\\. A New Search Engine** The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible. I don't know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be. Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently I've noticed some cracks in their fortress. The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their way was when they decided to get into the search business. That was not a natural move for Microsoft. They did it because they were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business. But this meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft's agenda, and (b) Microsoft's agenda consisted of stuff they weren't good at. Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook. That does not by itself mean there's room for a new search engine, but lately when using Google search I've found myself nostalgic for the old days, when Google was true to its own slightly aspy self. Google used to give me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter. Now the results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what's true is what's true for you. And the pages don't have the clean, sparse feel they used to. Google search results used to look like the output of a Unix utility. Now if I accidentally put the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen. The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use. A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine. And for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems thinkable to me. Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000 hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the search engine you yourself want. Feel free to make it excessively hackerish. Make it really good for code search, for example. Would you like search queries to be Turing complete? Anything that gets you those 10,000 users is ipso facto good. Don't worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the long term, because if you don't get that initial core of users, there won't be a long term. If you can just build something that you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you're already about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they probably didn't realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads. **2\\. Replace Email** Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now. Email is not a messaging protocol. It's a todo list. Or rather, my inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it. But it is a disastrously bad todo list. I'm open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I suspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email has to be replaced with a new protocol. This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, not a messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case where what someone wants you to do is: read the following text. As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power to the recipient than email does. I want there to be more restrictions on what someone can put on my todo list. And when someone can put something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what they want from me. Do they want me to do something beyond just reading some text? How important is it? (There obviously has to be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is important.) When does it have to be done? This is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible to replace. On the other, it seems unlikely that people in 100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now. And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now? If you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken and egg problem new protocols face, because some of the most powerful people in the world will be among the first to switch to it. They're all at the mercy of email too. Whatever you build, make it fast. GMail has become painfully slow. [2] If you made something no better than GMail, but fast, that alone would let you start to pull users away from GMail. GMail is slow because Google can't afford to spend a lot on it. But people will pay for this. I'd have no problem paying $50 a month. Considering how much time I spend in email, it's kind of scary to think how much I'd be justified in paying. At least $1000 a month. If I spend several hours a day reading and writing email, that would be a cheap way to make my life better. **3\\. Replace Universities** People are all over this idea lately, and I think they're onto something. I'm reluctant to suggest that an institution that's been around for a millennium is finished just because of some mistakes they made in the last few decades, but certainly in the last few decades US universities seem to have been headed down the wrong path. One could do a lot better for a lot less money. I don't think universities will disappear. They won't be replaced wholesale. They'll just lose the de facto monopoly on certain types of learning that they once had. There will be many different ways to learn different things, and some may look quite different from universities. Y Combinator itself is arguably one of them. Learning is such a big problem that changing the way people do it will have a wave of secondary effects. For example, the name of the university one went to is treated by a lot of people (correctly or not) as a credential in its own right. If learning breaks up into many little pieces, credentialling may separate from it. There may even need to be replacements for campus social life (and oddly enough, YC even has aspects of that). You could replace high schools too, but there you face bureaucratic obstacles that would slow down a startup. Universities seem the place to start. **4\\. Internet Drama** Hollywood has been slow to embrace the Internet. That was a mistake, because I think we can now call a winner in the race between delivery mechanisms, and it is the Internet, not cable. A lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also known as TVs. Our family didn't wait for Apple TV. We hated our last TV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac bolted to the wall. It's a little inconvenient to control it with a wireless mouse, but the overall experience is much better than the nightmare UI we had to deal with before. Some of the attention people currently devote to watching movies and TV can be stolen by things that seem completely unrelated, like social networking apps. More can be stolen by things that are a little more closely related, like games. But there will probably always remain some residual demand for conventional drama, where you sit passively and watch as a plot happens. So how do you deliver drama via the Internet? Whatever you make will have to be on a larger scale than Youtube clips. When people sit down to watch a show, they want to know what they're going to get: either part of a series with familiar characters, or a single longer \"movie\" whose basic premise they know in advance. There are two ways delivery and payment could play out. Either some company like Netflix or Apple will be the app store for entertainment, and you'll reach audiences through them. Or the would-be app stores will be too overreaching, or too technically inflexible, and companies will arise to supply payment and streaming a la carte to the producers of drama. If that's the way things play out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies. **5\\. The Next Steve Jobs** I was talking recently to someone who knew Apple well, and I asked him if the people now running the company would be able to keep creating new things the way Apple had under Steve Jobs. His answer was simply \"no.\" I already feared that would be the answer. I asked more to see how he'd qualify it. But he didn't qualify it at all. No, there will be no more great new stuff beyond whatever's currently in the pipeline. Apple's revenues may continue to rise for a long time, but as Microsoft shows, revenue is a lagging indicator in the technology business. So if Apple's not going to make the next iPad, who is? None of the existing players. None of them are run by product visionaries, and empirically you can't seem to get those by hiring them. Empirically the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the company and not get fired. So the company that creates the next wave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup. I realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try to become as big as Apple. But no more ambitious than it was for Apple to become as big as Apple, and they did it. Plus a startup taking on this problem now has an advantage the original Apple didn't: the example of Apple. Steve Jobs has shown us what's possible. That helps would-be successors both directly, as Roger Bannister did, by showing how much better you can do than people did before, and indirectly, as Augustus did, by lodging the idea in users' minds that a single person could unroll the future for them. [3] Now Steve is gone there's a vacuum we can all feel. If a new company led boldly into the future of hardware, users would follow. The CEO of that company, the \"next Steve Jobs,\" might not measure up to Steve Jobs. But he wouldn't have to. He'd just have to do a better job than Samsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems pretty doable. **6\\. Bring Back Moore's Law** The last 10 years have reminded us what Moore's Law actually says. Till about 2002 you could safely misinterpret it as promising that clock speeds would double every 18 months. Actually what it says is that circuit densities will double every 18 months. It used to seem pedantic to point that out. Not any more. Intel can no longer give us faster CPUs, just more of them. This Moore's Law is not as good as the old one. Moore's Law used to mean that if your software was slow, all you had to do was wait, and the inexorable progress of hardware would solve your problems. Now if your software is slow you have to rewrite it to do more things in parallel, which is a lot more work than waiting. It would be great if a startup could give us something of the old Moore's Law back, by writing software that could make a large number of CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU. There are several ways to approach this problem. The most ambitious is to try to do it automatically: to write a compiler that will parallelize our code for us. There's a name for this compiler, _the sufficiently smart compiler,_ and it is a byword for impossibility. But is it really impossible? Is there no configuration of the bits in memory of a present day computer that is this compiler? If you really think so, you should try to prove it, because that would be an interesting result. And if it's not impossible but simply very hard, it might be worth trying to write it. The expected value would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low. The reason the expected value is so high is web services. If you could write software that gave programmers the convenience of the way things were in the old days, you could offer it to them as a web service. And that would in turn mean that you got practically all the users. Imagine there was another processor manufacturer that could still translate increased circuit densities into increased clock speeds. They'd take most of Intel's business. And since web services mean that no one sees their processors anymore, by writing the sufficiently smart compiler you could create a situation indistinguishable from you being that manufacturer, at least for the server market. The least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start from the other end, and offer programmers more parallelizable Lego blocks to build programs out of, like Hadoop and MapReduce. Then the programmer still does much of the work of optimization. There's an intriguing middle ground where you build a semi-automatic weapon—where there's a human in the loop. You make something that looks to the user like the sufficiently smart compiler, but inside has people, using highly developed optimization tools to find and eliminate bottlenecks in users' programs. These people might be your employees, or you might create a marketplace for optimization. An optimization marketplace would be a way to generate the sufficiently smart compiler piecemeal, because participants would immediately start writing bots. It would be a curious state of affairs if you could get to the point where everything could be done by bots, because then you'd have made the sufficiently smart compiler, but no one person would have a complete copy of it. I realize how crazy all this sounds. In fact, what I like about this idea is all the different ways in which it's wrong. The whole idea of focusing on optimization is counter to the general trend in software development for the last several decades. Trying to write the sufficiently smart compiler is by definition a mistake. And even if it weren't, compilers are the sort of software that's supposed to be created by open source projects, not companies. Plus if this works it will deprive all the programmers who take pleasure in making multithreaded apps of so much amusing complexity. The forum troll I have by now internalized doesn't even know where to begin in raising objections to this project. Now that's what I call a startup idea. **7\\. Ongoing Diagnosis** But wait, here's another that could face even greater resistance: ongoing, automatic medical diagnosis. One of my tricks for generating startup ideas is to imagine the ways in which we'll seem backward to future generations. And I'm pretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, it will seem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptoms to be diagnosed with conditions like heart disease and cancer. For example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short of breath. Doctors discovered that several of his arteries were over 90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass. It seems reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available. And yet even he had to wait till his arteries were over 90% blocked to learn that the number was over 90%. Surely at some point in the future we'll know these numbers the way we now know something like our weight. Ditto for cancer. It will seem preposterous to future generations that we wait till patients have physical symptoms to be diagnosed with cancer. Cancer will show up on some sort of radar screen immediately. (Of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different from what we think of now as cancer. I wouldn't be surprised if at any given time we have ten or even hundreds of microcancers going at once, none of which normally amount to anything.) A lot of the obstacles to ongoing diagnosis will come from the fact that it's going against the grain of the medical profession. The way medicine has always worked is that patients come to doctors with problems, and the doctors figure out what's wrong. A lot of doctors don't like the idea of going on the medical equivalent of what lawyers call a \"fishing expedition,\" where you go looking for problems without knowing what you're looking for. They call the things that get discovered this way \"incidentalomas,\" and they are something of a nuisance. For example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as part of a study. She was horrified when the doctors running the study discovered what appeared to be a large tumor. After further testing, it turned out to be a harmless cyst. But it cost her a few days of terror. A lot of doctors worry that if you start scanning people with no symptoms, you'll get this on a giant scale: a huge number of false alarms that make patients panic and require expensive and perhaps even dangerous tests to resolve. But I think that's just an artifact of current limitations. If people were scanned all the time and we got better at deciding what was a real problem, my friend would have known about this cyst her whole life and known it was harmless, just as we do a birthmark. There is room for a lot of startups here. In addition to the technical obstacles all startups face, and the bureaucratic obstacles all medical startups face, they'll be going against thousands of years of medical tradition. But it will happen, and it will be a great thing—so great that people in the future will feel as sorry for us as we do for the generations that lived before anaesthesia and antibiotics. **Tactics** Let me conclude with some tactical advice. If you want to take on a problem as big as the ones I've discussed, don't make a direct frontal attack on it. Don't say, for example, that you're going to replace email. If you do that you raise too many expectations. Your employees and investors will constantly be asking \"are we there yet?\" and you'll have an army of haters waiting to see you fail. Just say you're building todo-list software. That sounds harmless. People can notice you've replaced email when it's a _fait accompli_. [4] Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things. Want to dominate microcomputer software? Start by writing a Basic interpreter for a machine with a few thousand users. Want to make the universal web site? Start by building a site for Harvard undergrads to stalk one another. Empirically, it's not just for other people that you need to start small. You need to for your own sake. Neither Bill Gates nor Mark Zuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going to get. All they knew was that they were onto something. Maybe it's a bad idea to have really big ambitions initially, because the bigger your ambition, the longer it's going to take, and the further you project into the future, the more likely you'll get it wrong. I think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify a precise point in the future and then ask yourself how to get from here to there, like the popular image of a visionary. You'll be better off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a general westerly direction. Don't try to construct the future like a building, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken. Start with something you know works, and when you expand, expand westward. The popular image of the visionary is someone with a clear view of the future, but empirically it may be better to have a blurry one. **Notes** [1] It's also one of the most important things VCs fail to understand about startups. Most expect founders to walk in with a clear plan for the future, and judge them based on that. Few consciously realize that in the biggest successes there is the least correlation between the initial plan and what the startup eventually becomes. [2] This sentence originally read \"GMail is painfully slow.\" Thanks to Paul Buchheit for the correction. [3] Roger Bannister is famous as the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes. But his world record only lasted 46 days. Once he showed it could be done, lots of others followed. Ten years later Jim Ryun ran a 3:59 mile as a high school junior. [4] If you want to be the next Apple, maybe you don't even want to start with consumer electronics. Maybe at first you make something hackers use. Or you make something popular but apparently unimportant, like a headset or router. All you need is a bridgehead. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Aaron Iba, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Harj Taggar and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this. May 2006 _(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech. )_ Startups happen in clusters. There are a lot of them in Silicon Valley and Boston, and few in Chicago or Miami. A country that wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes these clusters form. I've claimed that the [recipe](siliconvalley.html) is a great university near a town smart people like. If you set up those conditions within the US, startups will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece of metal. But when I consider what it would take to reproduce Silicon Valley in another country, it's clear the US is a particularly humid environment. Startups condense more easily here. It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley in another country. There's room not merely to equal Silicon Valley, but to surpass it. But if you want to do that, you have to understand the advantages startups get from being in America. **1\\. The US Allows Immigration. ** For example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon Valley in Japan, because one of Silicon Valley's most distinctive features is immigration. Half the people there speak with accents. And the Japanese don't like immigration. When they think about how to make a Japanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciously frame it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people. This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure. A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious, and you can't have a mecca if you don't let people into it. Of course, it's not saying much that America is more open to immigration than Japan. Immigration policy is one area where a competitor could do better. **2\\. The US Is a Rich Country. ** I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley. Obviously they have the right people: you can tell that by the number of Indians in the current Silicon Valley. The problem with India itself is that it's still so poor. In poor countries, things we take for granted are missing. A friend of mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the steps in a railway station. When she turned to see what had happened, she found the steps were all different heights. In industrialized countries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think about this, because there's an infrastructure that prevents such a staircase from being built. The US has never been so poor as some countries are now. There have never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities. So we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms-of-beggars stage to the silicon-valley stage. Could you have both at once, or does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a silicon valley? I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution of an economy. Economies are made out of people, and attitudes can only change a certain amount per generation. [1] **3\\. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State. ** Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is China. But I doubt they could do it yet either. China still seems to be a police state, and although present rulers seem enlightened compared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably only get you part way toward being a great economic power. It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere. Can it get you the designers, though? Can imagination flourish where people can't criticize the government? Imagination means having odd ideas, and it's hard to have odd ideas about technology without also having odd ideas about politics. And in any case, many technical ideas do have political implications. So if you squash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technical fields. [2] Singapore would face a similar problem. Singapore seems very aware of the importance of encouraging startups. But while energetic government intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently, it can't coax startups into existence. A state that bans chewing gum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco. Do you need a San Francisco? Might there not be an alternate route to innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation instead of individualism? Possibly, but I'd bet not. Most imaginative people seem to share a certain prickly [independence](gba.html), whenever and wherever they lived. You see it in Diogenes telling Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later in Feynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos. [3] Imaginative people don't want to follow or lead. They're most productive when everyone gets to do what they want. Ironically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil liberties recently. But I'm not too worried yet. I'm hoping once the present administration is out, the natural openness of American culture will reassert itself. **4\\. American Universities Are Better. ** You need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so far there are few outside the US. I asked a handful of American computer science professors which universities in Europe were most admired, and they all basically said \"Cambridge\" followed by a long pause while they tried to think of others. There don't seem to be many universities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, at least in technology. In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy. The German and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try to ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality. The downside is that none are especially good. The best professors are spread out, instead of being concentrated as they are in the US. This probably makes them less productive, because they don't have good colleagues to inspire them. It also means no one university will be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroad and causing startups to form around it. The case of Germany is a strange one. The Germans invented the modern university, and up till the 1930s theirs were the best in the world. Now they have none that stand out. As I was mulling this over, I found myself thinking: \"I can understand why German universities declined in the 1930s, after they excluded Jews. But surely they should have bounced back by now.\" Then I realized: maybe not. There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know would not want to move there. And if you took any great American university and removed the Jews, you'd have some pretty big gaps. So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley in Germany, because you couldn't establish the level of university you'd need as a seed. [4] It's natural for US universities to compete with one another because so many are private. To reproduce the quality of American universities you probably also have to reproduce this. If universities are controlled by the central government, log-rolling will pull them all toward the mean: the new Institute of X will end up at the university in the district of a powerful politician, instead of where it should be. **5\\. You Can Fire People in America. ** I think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe is the attitude toward employment. The famously rigid labor laws hurt every company, but startups especially, because startups have the least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles. The difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startups because they have no redundancy. Every person has to do their job well. But the problem is more than just that some startup might have a problem firing someone they needed to. Across industries and countries, there's a strong inverse correlation between performance and job security. Actors and directors are fired at the end of each film, so they have to deliver every time. Junior professors are fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses to grant them tenure. Professional athletes know they'll be pulled if they play badly for just a couple games. At the other end of the scale (at least in the US) are auto workers, New York City schoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossible to fire. The trend is so clear that you'd have to be willfully blind not to see it. Performance isn't everything, you say? Well, are auto workers, schoolteachers, and civil servants _happier_ than actors, professors, and professional athletes? European public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired in industries where they really care about performance. Unfortunately the only industry they care enough about so far is soccer. But that is at least a precedent. **6\\. In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment. ** The problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goes deeper than the employment laws. More dangerous is the attitude they reflect: that an employee is a kind of servant, whom the employer has a duty to protect. It used to be that way in America too. In 1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a big company, for whom ideally you'd work your whole career. In return the company would take care of you: they'd try not to fire you, cover your medical expenses, and support you in old age. Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones and becoming simply an economic exchange. But the importance of the new model is not just that it makes it easier for startups to grow. More important, I think, is that it it makes it easier for people to _start_ startups. Even in the US most kids graduating from college still think they're supposed to get jobs, as if you couldn't be productive without being someone's employee. But the less you identify work with employment, the easier it becomes to start a startup. When you see your career as a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime's service to a single employer, there's less risk in starting your own company, because you're only replacing one segment instead of discarding the whole thing. The old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup founders have had to struggle against them. A year after the founding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn't quit HP. He still planned to work there for life. And when Jobs found someone to give Apple serious venture funding, on the condition that Woz quit, he initially refused, arguing that he'd designed both the Apple I and the Apple II while working at HP, and there was no reason he couldn't continue. **7\\. America Is Not Too Fussy. ** If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval startups will break most of them, because they don't know what the laws are and don't have time to find out. For example, many startups in America begin in places where it's not really legal to run a business. Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and Google were all run out of garages. Many more startups, including ours, were initially run out of apartments. If the laws against such things were actually enforced, most startups wouldn't happen. That could be a problem in fussier countries. If Hewlett and Packard tried running an electronics company out of their garage in Switzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the municipal authorities. But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort required just to start a company. A friend of mine started a company in Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, among many other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to incorporate. That's one reason I'm not typing this on an Apfel laptop. Jobs and Wozniak couldn't have come up with that kind of money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator. We couldn't have started Viaweb either. [5] Here's a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: read the stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate what would have happened in your country. When you hit something that would have killed Apple, prune it off. _Startups are[marginal](marginal.html)._ They're started by the poor and the timid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they're started by people who are supposed to be doing something else; and though businesses, their founders often know nothing about business. Young startups are fragile. A society that trims its margins sharply will kill them all. **8\\. America Has a Large Domestic Market. ** What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting their initial product out. The successful ones therefore make the first version as simple as possible. In the US they usually begin by making something just for the local market. This works in America, because the local market is 300 million people. It wouldn't work so well in Sweden. In a small country, a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from the start. The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic market. The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many different languages. So a software startup in Sweden is still at a disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal with internationalization from the beginning. It's significant that the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a problem that was intrinsically international. However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few decades speak a single language. When I was a student in Italy in 1990, few Italians spoke English. Now all educated people seem to be expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated. This is presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue, French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish: they'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists. **9\\. America Has Venture Funding. ** Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easier to get. There are now a few VC firms outside the US, but startup funding doesn't only come from VC firms. A more important source, because it's more personal and comes earlier in the process, is money from individual angel investors. Google might never have got to the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if they hadn't first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim. And he could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun. This pattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs. It's this pattern that _makes_ them startup hubs. The good news is, all you have to do to get the process rolling is get those first few startups successfully launched. If they stick around after they get rich, startup founders will almost automatically fund and encourage new startups. The bad news is that the cycle is slow. It probably takes five years, on average, before a startup founder can make angel investments. And while governments _might_ be able to set up local VC funds by supplying the money themselves and recruiting people from existing firms to run them, only organic growth can produce angel investors. Incidentally, America's private universities are one reason there's so much venture capital. A lot of the money in VC funds comes from their endowments. So another advantage of private universities is that a good chunk of the country's wealth is managed by enlightened investors. **10\\. America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers. ** Compared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganized about routing people into careers. For example, in America people often don't decide to go to medical school till they've finished college. In Europe they generally decide in high school. The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a single, definite occupation-- which is not far from the idea that each person has a natural \"station\" in life. If this were true, the most efficient plan would be to discover each person's station as early as possible, so they could receive the training appropriate to it. In the US things are more haphazard. But that turns out to be an advantage as an economy gets more liquid, just as dynamic typing turns out to work better than static for ill-defined problems. This is particularly true with startups. \"Startup founder\" is not the sort of career a high school student would choose. If you ask at that age, people will choose conservatively. They'll choose well-understood occupations like engineer, or doctor, or lawyer. Startups are the kind of thing people don't plan, so you're more likely to get them in a society where it's ok to make career decisions on the fly. For example, in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train you to do research. But fortunately in the US this is another rule that isn't very strictly enforced. In the US most people in CS PhD programs are there simply because they wanted to learn more. They haven't decided what they'll do afterward. So American grad schools spawn a lot of startups, because students don't feel they're failing if they don't go into research. Those worried about America's \"competitiveness\" often suggest spending more on public schools. But perhaps America's lousy public schools have a hidden advantage. Because they're so bad, the kids adopt an attitude of waiting for college. I did; I knew I was learning so little that I wasn't even learning what the choices were, let alone which to choose. This is demoralizing, but it does at least make you keep an open mind. Certainly if I had to choose between bad high schools and good universities, like the US, and good high schools and bad universities, like most other industrialized countries, I'd take the US system. Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child prodigy. **Attitudes** There's one item conspicuously missing from this list: American attitudes. Americans are said to be more entrepreneurial, and less afraid of risk. But America has no monopoly on this. Indians and Chinese seem plenty entrepreneurial, perhaps more than Americans. Some say Europeans are less energetic, but I don't believe it. I think the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but that they lack examples. Even in the US, the most successful startup founders are often technical people who are quite timid, initially, about the idea of starting their own company. Few are the sort of backslapping extroverts one thinks of as typically American. They can usually only summon up the activation energy to start a startup when they meet people who've done it and realize they could too. I think what holds back European hackers is simply that they don't meet so many people who've done it. You see that variation even within the US. Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than Yale students, but not because of some difference in their characters; the Yale students just have fewer examples. I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in Europe and the US. In the US it's ok to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe it's not. But this can't be an intrinsically European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious as Americans. What happened? My hypothesis is that ambition was discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first half of the twentieth century. Now swagger is out. (Even now the image of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn't it?) It would be surprising if European attitudes weren't affected by the disasters of the twentieth century. It takes a while to be optimistic after events like that. But ambition is human nature. Gradually it will re-emerge. [6] **How To Do Better** I don't mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfect place for startups. It's the best place so far, but the sample size is small, and \"so far\" is not very long. On historical time scales, what we have now is just a prototype. So let's look at Silicon Valley the way you'd look at a product made by a competitor. What weaknesses could you exploit? How could you make something users would like better? The users in this case are those critical few thousand people you'd like to move to your silicon valley. To start with, Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco. Palo Alto, the original ground zero, is about thirty miles away, and the present center more like forty. So people who come to work in Silicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boring sprawl of the valley proper, or live in San Francisco and endure an hour commute each way. The best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer to the interesting city, but interesting itself. And there is a lot of room for improvement here. Palo Alto is not so bad, but everything built since is the worst sort of strip development. You can measure how demoralizing it is by the number of people who will sacrifice two hours a day commuting rather than live there. Another area in which you could easily surpass Silicon Valley is public transportation. There is a train running the length of it, and by American standards it's not bad. Which is to say that to Japanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the third world. The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like to get around by train, bicycle, and on foot. So if you want to beat America, design a town that puts cars last. It will be a while before any American city can bring itself to do that. **Capital Gains** There are also a couple things you could do to beat America at the national level. One would be to have lower capital gains taxes. It doesn't seem critical to have the lowest _income_ taxes, because to take advantage of those, people have to move. [7] But if capital gains rates vary, you move assets, not yourself, so changes are reflected at market speeds. The lower the rate, the cheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real estate, or bonds, or stocks bought for the dividends they pay. So if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate on capital gains. Politicians are caught between a rock and a hard place here, however: make the capital gains rate low and be accused of creating \"tax breaks for the rich,\" or make it high and starve growing companies of investment capital. As Galbraith said, politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the disastrous. A lot of governments experimented with the disastrous in the twentieth century; now the trend seems to be toward the merely unpalatable. Oddly enough, the leaders now are European countries like Belgium, which has a capital gains tax rate of zero. **Immigration** The other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigration policy. There are huge gains to be made here. Silicon valleys are made of people, remember. Like a company whose software runs on Windows, those in the current Silicon Valley are all too aware of the shortcomings of the INS, but there's little they can do about it. They're hostages of the platform. America's immigration system has never been well run, and since 2001 there has been an additional admixture of paranoia. What fraction of the smart people who want to come to America can even get in? I doubt even half. Which means if you made a competing technology hub that let in all smart people, you'd immediately get more than half the world's top talent, for free. US immigration policy is particularly ill-suited to startups, because it reflects a model of work from the 1970s. It assumes good technical people have college degrees, and that work means working for a big company. If you don't have a college degree you can't get an H1B visa, the type usually issued to programmers. But a test that excludes Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can't be a good one. Plus you can't get a visa for working on your own company, only for working as an employee of someone else's. And if you want to apply for citizenship you daren't work for a startup at all, because if your sponsor goes out of business, you have to start over. American immigration policy keeps out most smart people, and channels the rest into unproductive jobs. It would be easy to do better. Imagine if, instead, you treated immigration like recruiting-- if you made a conscious effort to seek out the smartest people and get them to come to your country. A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage. At this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply by having an immigration system that let them in. **A Good Vector** If you look at the kinds of things you have to do to create an environment where startups condense, none are great sacrifices. Great universities? Livable towns? Civil liberties? Flexible employment laws? Immigration policies that let in smart people? Tax laws that encourage growth? It's not as if you have to risk destroying your country to get a silicon valley; these are all good things in their own right. And then of course there's the question, can you afford not to? I can imagine a future in which the default choice of ambitious young people is to start their [own](hiring.html) company rather than work for someone else's. I'm not sure that will happen, but it's where the trend points now. And if that is the future, places that don't have startups will be a whole step behind, like those that missed the Industrial Revolution. **Notes** [1] On the verge of the Industrial Revolution, England was already the richest country in the world. As far as such things can be compared, per capita income in England in 1750 was higher than India's in 1960. Deane, Phyllis, _The First Industrial Revolution_ , Cambridge University Press, 1965. [2] This has already happened once in China, during the Ming Dynasty, when the country turned its back on industrialization at the command of the court. One of Europe's advantages was that it had no government powerful enough to do that. [3] Of course, Feynman and Diogenes were from adjacent traditions, but Confucius, though more polite, was no more willing to be told what to think. [4] For similar reasons it might be a lost cause to try to establish a silicon valley in Israel. Instead of no Jews moving there, only Jews would move there, and I don't think you could build a silicon valley out of just Jews any more than you could out of just Japanese. (This is not a remark about the qualities of these groups, just their sizes. Japanese are only about 2% of the world population, and Jews about .2%.) [5] According to the World Bank, the initial capital requirement for German companies is 47.6% of the per capita income. Doh. World Bank, _Doing Business in 2006_ , http://doingbusiness.org [6] For most of the twentieth century, Europeans looked back on the summer of 1914 as if they'd been living in a dream world. It seems more accurate (or at least, as accurate) to call the years after 1914 a nightmare than to call those before a dream. A lot of the optimism Europeans consider distinctly American is simply what they too were feeling in 1914. [7] The point where things start to go wrong seems to be about 50%. Above that people get serious about tax avoidance. The reason is that the payoff for avoiding tax grows hyperexponentially (x/1-x for 0 < x < 1). If your income tax rate is 10%, moving to Monaco would only give you 11% more income, which wouldn't even cover the extra cost. If it's 90%, you'd get ten times as much income. And at 98%, as it was briefly in Britain in the 70s, moving to Monaco would give you fifty times as much income. It seems quite likely that European governments of the 70s never drew this curve. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Matthias Felleisen, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Neil Rimer, Hugues Steinier, Brad Templeton, Fred Wilson, and Stephen Wolfram for reading drafts of this, and to Ed Dumbill for inviting me to speak. March 2009 _(This essay is derived from a talk at[AngelConf](http://angelconf.org). )_ When we sold our startup in 1998 I thought one day I'd do some angel investing. Seven years later I still hadn't started. I put it off because it seemed mysterious and complicated. It turns out to be easier than I expected, and also more interesting. The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really isn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock. You'll probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding round. [1] There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the other. The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler. But really it doesn't matter much which you use. Don't spend much time worrying about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start angel investing. That's not how you win at this game. When you hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not saying \"He got a 4x liquidation preference.\" They're saying \"He invested in Google.\" That's how you win: by investing in the right startups. That is so much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading you by even talking about other things. **Mechanics** Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together to invest on the same terms. In a syndicate there is usually a \"lead\" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup. But not always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of investors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer supplies the paperwork. The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a friend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates. Then all you have to do is write checks. Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though. It's not that hard to do it yourself. You can just use the standard [series AA](http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html) documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online. You should of course have your lawyer review everything. Both you and the startup should have lawyers. But the lawyers don't have to create the agreement from scratch. [2] When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you care about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of the company. The valuation determines how much stock you get. If you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1 million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you get .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock. If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just as you did. If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%. That's ok. Dilution is normal. What saves you from being mistreated in future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the founders. They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just as much. And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up [net ahead](equity.html). So in theory, each further round of investment leaves you with a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after several more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has become $5 million. [3] The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that let you contribute to future rounds to maintain your percentage. So it's your choice whether you get diluted. [4] If the company does really well, you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so high it's not worth it for you. How much does an angel invest? That varies enormously, from $10,000 to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions. The upper bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise. The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever is greater. A typical angel round these days might be $150,000 raised from 5 people. Valuations don't vary as much. For angel rounds it's rare to see a valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million. 4 million is starting to be VC territory. How do you decide what valuation to offer? If you're part of a round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you. But what if you're investing by yourself? There's no real answer. There is no rational way to value an early stage startup. The valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's bargaining position. If they really want you, either because they desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot, they'll let you invest at a low valuation. If they don't need you, it will be higher. So guess. The startup may not have any more idea what the number should be than you do. [5] Ultimately it doesn't matter much. When angels make a lot of money from a deal, it's not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5 million instead of $3 million. It's because the company was really successful. I can't emphasize that too much. Don't get hung up on mechanics or deal terms. What you should spend your time thinking about is whether the company is good. (Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal terms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the company good.) There's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how much you're expected to help the startup. Like the amount you invest, this can vary a lot. You don't have to do anything if you don't want to; you could simply be a source of money. Or you can become a de facto employee of the company. Just make sure that you and the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you'll do for them. Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels. The ones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors, and only take money from people who are famous and/or will work hard for them. But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of time or you won't get to invest in any good startups. There is a surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is and how well it ends up doing. Lots of hot startups will end up failing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding. And the latter are so desperate for money that they'll take it from anyone at a low valuation. [6] **Picking Winners** It would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn't it? The part of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, picking the right companies, is also the hardest. So you should practically ignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything I've told you so far. You may need to refer to it at some point, but it is not the central issue. The central issue is picking the right startups. What \"Make something people want\" is for startups, \"Pick the right startups\" is for investors. Combined they yield \"Pick the startups that will make something people want.\" How do you do that? It's not as simple as picking startups that are already making something wildly popular. By then it's too late for angels. VCs will already be onto them. As an angel, you have to pick startups before they've got a hit—either because they've made something great but users don't realize it yet, like Google early on, or because they're still an iteration or two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were making software for transferring money between PDAs. To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential. That's what it comes down to. VCs can be fast followers. Most of them don't try to predict what will win. They just try to notice quickly when something already is winning. But angels have to be able to predict. [7] One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot of people out there who have never even made an angel investment and yet are already better angel investors than they realize. Someone who doesn't know the first thing about the mechanics of venture funding but knows what a successful startup founder looks like is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets inside out, but thinks [\"hacker\"](gba.html) means someone who breaks into computers. If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with them—if you both resonate at the same frequency—then you may already be a better startup picker than the median professional VC. [8] Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year after me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at picking startups. My extra year of experience was rounding error compared to our ability to empathize with founders. What makes a good founder? If there were a word that meant the opposite of hapless, that would be the one. Bad founders seem hapless. They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm them and they get discouraged and give up. Good founders make things happen the way they want. Which is not to say they force things to happen in a predefined way. Good founders have a healthy respect for reality. But they are relentlessly resourceful. That's the closest I can get to the opposite of hapless. You want to fund people who are relentlessly resourceful. Notice we started out talking about things, and now we're talking about people. There is an ongoing debate between investors which is more important, the people, or the idea—or more precisely, the market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it's the people—that the idea will change, but the people are the foundation of the company. Whereas Marc Andreessen says he'd back ok founders in a hot market over great founders in a bad one. [9] These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good people find good markets. Bill Gates would probably have ended up pretty rich even if IBM hadn't happened to drop the PC standard in his lap. I've thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who prefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets. It's kind of surprising that it even exists. You'd expect opinions to have converged more. But I think I've figured out what's going on. The three most prominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim, and Joe Kraus. And all three of them, in their own startups, basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast that it was all they could do to keep up with it. That kind of experience is hard to ignore. Plus I think they underestimate themselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge thermal upward, and they think \"anyone could have done it.\" But that isn't true; they are not ordinary people. So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and bet on people. Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predict them—not even the founders, and certainly not you as an investor. And only good people can ride the thermals if they hit them anyway. **Deal Flow** Of course the question of how to choose startups presumes you have startups to choose between. How do you find them? This is yet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates. If you tag along on a friend's investments, you don't have to find startups. The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream of reasonably high quality ones. The traditional way to do this is through contacts. If you're friends with a lot of investors and founders, they'll send deals your way. The Valley basically runs on referrals. And once you start to become known as reliable, useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you. I certainly will. There's also a newer way to find startups, which is to come to events like Y Combinator's Demo Day, where a batch of newly created startups presents to investors all at once. We have two Demo Days a year, one in March and one in August. These are basically mass referrals. But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches between startups and investors. The personal referral is still the most common route. So if you want to hear about new startups, the best way to do it is to get lots of referrals. The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups. No matter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to send you referrals until you've proven yourself by doing a couple investments. Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky, high-maintenance investors. But once you prove yourself as a good investor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in both quality and quantity. At the extreme, for someone like Ron Conway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the whole Valley. So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to bootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investor in the startups you meet that way, and eventually you'll start a chain reaction. Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley. There probably aren't more than a couple hundred serious angels in the whole Valley, and yet they're probably the single most important ingredient in making the Valley what it is. Angels are the limiting reagent in startup formation. If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline for startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider. That is kind of mind-blowing. **Being Good** How do you be a good angel investor? The first thing you need is to be decisive. When we talk to founders about good and bad investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say \"he writes checks.\" That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone. Far from it. It means he makes up his mind quickly, and follows through. You may be thinking, how hard could that be? You'll see when you try it. It follows from the nature of angel investing that the decisions are hard. You have to guess early, at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive, because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded them. Suppose it's 1998. You come across a startup founded by a couple grad students. They say they're going to work on Internet search. There are already a bunch of big public companies doing search. How can these grad students possibly compete with them? And does search even matter anyway? All the search engines are trying to get people to start calling them \"portals\" instead. Why would you want to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who are trying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area they themselves have declared passe? And yet the grad students seem pretty smart. What do you do? There's a hack for being decisive when you're inexperienced: ratchet down the size of your investment till it's an amount you wouldn't care too much about losing. For every rich person (you probably shouldn't try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich) there's some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to lose. Till you feel comfortable investing, don't invest more than that per startup. For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it would probably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000. That's less than .3% of your net worth. So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000 investments. Nothing will teach you about angel investing like experience. Treat the first few as an educational expense. $60,000 is less than a lot of graduate programs. Plus you get equity. What's really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to string founders along while trying to gather more information about the startup's trajectory. [10] There's always a temptation to do that, because you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciously resist it. In the long term it's to your advantage to be good. The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to be a good person. Angel investing is not a business where you make money by screwing people over. Startups create wealth, and creating wealth is not a zero sum game. No one has to lose for you to win. In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they'll just get demoralized and the company will do worse. Plus your referrals will dry up. So I recommend being good. The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good people. Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help it. And they'll help people they haven't invested in too. When they do favors they don't seem to keep track of them. It's too much overhead. They just try to help everyone, and assume good things will flow back to them somehow. Empirically that seems to work. **Notes** [1] Convertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation, or can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out to be when it converts. E.g. convertible debt at a discount of 30% means when it converts you get stock as if you'd invested at a 30% lower valuation. That can be useful in cases where you can't or don't want to figure out what the valuation should be. You leave it to the next investor. On the other hand, a lot of investors want to know exactly what they're getting, so they will only do convertible debt with a cap. [2] The expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is not writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred dollars an hour over the details. That's why the series AA paperwork aims at a middle ground. You can just start from the compromise you'd have reached after lots of back and forth. When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists in startups. Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this. Their inexperience makes them overbuild: they'll create huge, overcomplicated agreements, and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things. In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick, Fenwick & West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward. In Boston the best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag. [3] Your mileage may vary. [4] These anti-dilution provisions also protect you against tricks like a later investor trying to steal the company by doing another round that values the company at $1. If you have a competent startup lawyer handle the deal for you, you should be protected against such tricks initially. But it could become a problem later. If a big VC firm wants to invest in the startup after you, they may try to make you take out your anti-dilution protections. And if they do the startup will be pressuring you to agree. They'll tell you that if you don't, you're going to kill their deal with the VC. I recommend you solve this problem by having a gentlemen's agreement with the founders: agree with them in advance that you're not going to give up your anti-dilution protections. Then it's up to them to tell VCs early on. The reason you don't want to give them up is the following scenario. The VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional funding at a pre- money valuation of zero. This wipes out the existing shareholders, including both you and the founders. They then grant the founders lots of options, because they need them to stay around, but you get nothing. Obviously this is not a nice thing to do. It doesn't happen often. Brand-name VCs wouldn't recapitalize a company just to steal a few percent from an angel. But there's a continuum here. A less upstanding, lower-tier VC might be tempted to do it to steal a big chunk of stock. I'm not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your anti- dilution protections. Everything is a negotiation. If you're part of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal protections and rely on social ones. If you invest in a deal led by a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you're pretty well protected against being mistreated, because any VC would think twice before crossing him. This kind of protection is one of the reasons angels like to invest in syndicates. [5] Don't invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you end up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you're sure your money will be the last they ever need. Later stage investors won't invest in a company if the founders don't have enough equity left to motivate them. I talked to a VC recently who said he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned them down because investors already owned more than half of it. Those investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were shooting themselves in the foot. [6] At any given time I know of at least 3 or 4 YC alumni who I believe will be big successes but who are running on vapor, financially, because investors don't yet get what they're doing. (And no, unfortunately, I can't tell you who they are. I can't refer a startup to an investor I don't know.) [7] There are some VCs who can predict instead of reacting. Not surprisingly, these are the most successful ones. [8] It's somewhat sneaky of me to put it this way, because the median VC loses money. That's one of the most surprising things I've learned about VC while working on Y Combinator. Only a fraction of VCs even have positive returns. The rest exist to satisfy demand among fund managers for venture capital as an asset class. Learning this explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we were working on Viaweb. [9] VCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great people. But what they're really saying is they want both. They're so selective that they only even consider great people. So when they say they care above all about big markets, they mean that's how they choose between great people. [10] Founders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he's interested in investing but doesn't want to lead. There are circumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often than not what it means is \"No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal, I want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes.\" If you like a startup enough to invest in it, then invest in it. Just use the standard [series AA](http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html) terms and write them a check. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this. [Comment](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=506671) on this essay. November 2008 One of the differences between big companies and startups is that big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves against mistakes. A startup walks like a toddler, bashing into things and falling over all the time. A big company is more deliberate. The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all suppliers to prove they're solvent before submitting bids. As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in response to disasters they've suffered, or (probably more often) by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs for protecting against new types of disasters. It's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes. The problem is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the check itself has a cost. _Every check has a cost._ For example, consider the case of making suppliers verify their solvency. Surely that's mere prudence? But in fact it could have substantial costs. There's obviously the direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check proofs of the supplier's solvency. But the real costs are the ones you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier, but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified. Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short of the threshold for solvency—which will of course have been set on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it. Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check, they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost. No matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would at least remind everyone there had to _be_ a cost, and send them looking for it. If companies started doing that, they'd find some surprises. Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to corporate customers. He said that in most companies software costing up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee. But babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make sense to charge less than $50,000. Which means if you're making something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to sell it for $50,000 instead. The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company doesn't waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays 10 times as much. Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harder it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost. And not merely linearly, either. If you're hard enough to sell to, the people who are best at making things don't want to bother. The only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in selling to you. Then you've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency. Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliers are no longer in the market. Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all, governments. But checks instituted by governments can cause much worse problems than merely overpaying. Checks instituted by governments can cripple a country's whole economy. Up till about 1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe. One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government restricted long trading voyages. So it was left to the Europeans to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, including China. In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the US IPO market. That wasn't the intention of the legislators who wrote it. They just wanted to add a few more checks on public companies. But they forgot to consider the cost. They forgot that companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being public at all. Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing? Is it higher in some areas than others? Where does it increase discontinuously? If large organizations started to ask questions like that, they'd learn some frightening things. I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing. The reason is that software plays an increasingly important role in companies, and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks. Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones actually prefer to work hard. This doesn't seem to be the case in most types of work. When I worked in fast food, we didn't prefer the busy times. And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn't prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain. Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code. Or more precisely, when they release more code. Programmers like to make a difference. Good ones, anyway. For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a startup is that there are few checks on releases. In true startups, there are no external checks at all. If you have an idea for a new feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production servers before lunch. And when you can do that, you have more ideas. At big companies, software has to go through various approvals before it can be launched. And the cost of doing this can be enormous—in fact, discontinuous. I was talking recently to a group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few years before by a big company. When they'd been independent, they could release changes instantly. Now, they said, the absolute fastest they could get code released on the production servers was two weeks. This didn't merely make them less productive. It made them hate working for the acquirer. Here's a sign of how much programmers like to be able to work hard: these guys would have _paid_ to be able to release code immediately, the way they used to. I asked them if they'd trade 10% of the acquisition price for the ability to release code immediately, and all three instantly said yes. Then I asked what was the maximum percentage of the acquisition price they'd trade for it. They said they didn't want to think about it, because they didn't want to know how high they'd go, but I got the impression it might be as much as half. They'd have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps millions, just to be able to deliver more software to users. And you know what? It would have been perfectly safe to let them. In fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn't these guys have broken anything, they'd have gotten a lot more done. So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greater cost. Just like the committee approving software purchases. And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not that you overpay but that the best suppliers won't even sell to you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your programmers is not that you'll make them unproductive, but that good programmers won't even want to work for you. Steve Jobs's famous maxim \"artists ship\" works both ways. Artists aren't merely capable of shipping. They insist on it. So if you don't let people ship, you won't have any artists. **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). October 2008 The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies. When Microsoft and Apple were founded. As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time to start a startup. I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time either. The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't matter much either way. If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders. The economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success it's rounding error compared to the founders. Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it. If you're the right sort of person, you'll win even in a bad economy. And if you're not, a good economy won't save you. Someone who thinks \"I better not start a startup now, because the economy is so bad\" is making the same mistake as the people who thought during the Bubble \"all I have to do is start a startup, and I'll be rich.\" So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the economy. And if you're worried about threats to the survival of your company, don't look for them in the news. Look in the mirror. But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till the economy is better before taking the leap? If you're starting a restaurant, maybe, but not if you're working on technology. Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market. So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy will be higher than for waiting. Microsoft's first product was a Basic interpreter for the Altair. That was exactly what the world needed in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few years, it would have been too late. Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have. There are always new ideas. But if you have a specific idea you want to act on, act now. That doesn't mean you can ignore the economy. Both customers and investors will be feeling pinched. It's not necessarily a problem if customers feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making things that [save money](http://bountii.com). Startups often make things cheaper, so in that respect they're better positioned to prosper in a recession than big companies. Investors are more of a problem. Startups generally need to raise some amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less willing to invest in bad times. They shouldn't be. Everyone knows you're supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are good. But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking it's time to buy. You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and by definition only a minority of investors can be. So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be reluctant to invest even in good ones. You'll have to adapt to this. But that's nothing new: startups always have to adapt to the whims of investors. Ask any founder in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch the face they make. Last year you had to be prepared to explain how your startup was viral. Next year you'll have to explain how it's recession-proof. (Those are both good things to be. The mistake investors make is not the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one to the exclusion of the rest.) Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible. For years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world. The immediate cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill. And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession will if anything make it cheaper still. If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach even than to keep your job. Customers may drop off individually if they can no longer afford you, but you're not going to lose them all at once; markets don't \"reduce headcount.\" What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you can't find another? That could be a problem if you work in sales or marketing. In those fields it can take months to find a new job in a bad economy. But hackers seem to be more liquid. Good hackers can always get some kind of job. It might not be your dream job, but you're not going to starve. Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition. Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals. If everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to yourself. You're an investor too. As a founder, you're buying stock with work: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that they've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they were the first investors in Google. And like any investor you should buy when times are bad. Were you nodding in agreement, thinking \"stupid investors\" a few paragraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant to put money into startups in bad markets, even though that's the time they should rationally be most willing to buy? Well, founders aren't much better. When times get bad, hackers go to grad school. And no doubt that will happen this time too. In fact, what makes the preceding paragraph true is that most readers won't believe it—at least to the extent of acting on it. So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup. It's hard to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh disadvantages like reluctant investors. But it doesn't matter much either way. It's the people that matter. And for a given set of people working on a given technology, the time to act is always now. January 2003 _(This article was given as a talk at the 2003 Spam Conference. It describes the work I've done to improve the performance of the algorithm described in[A Plan for Spam](spam.html), and what I plan to do in the future. )_ The first discovery I'd like to present here is an algorithm for lazy evaluation of research papers. Just write whatever you want and don't cite any previous work, and indignant readers will send you references to all the papers you should have cited. I discovered this algorithm after ``A Plan for Spam'' [1] was on Slashdot. Spam filtering is a subset of text classification, which is a well established field, but the first papers about Bayesian spam filtering per se seem to have been two given at the same conference in 1998, one by Pantel and Lin [2], and another by a group from Microsoft Research [3]. When I heard about this work I was a bit surprised. If people had been onto Bayesian filtering four years ago, why wasn't everyone using it? When I read the papers I found out why. Pantel and Lin's filter was the more effective of the two, but it only caught 92% of spam, with 1.16% false positives. When I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter, it caught 99.5% of spam with less than .03% false positives [4]. It's always alarming when two people trying the same experiment get widely divergent results. It's especially alarming here because those two sets of numbers might yield opposite conclusions. Different users have different requirements, but I think for many people a filtering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives means that filtering is not an acceptable solution, whereas 99.5% with less than .03% false positives means that it is. So why did we get such different numbers? I haven't tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin's results, but from reading the paper I see five things that probably account for the difference. One is simply that they trained their filter on very little data: 160 spam and 466 nonspam mails. Filter performance should still be climbing with data sets that small. So their numbers may not even be an accurate measure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone of Bayesian spam filtering in general. But I think the most important difference is probably that they ignored message headers. To anyone who has worked on spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision. And yet in the very first filters I tried writing, I ignored the headers too. Why? Because I wanted to keep the problem neat. I didn't know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to me full of random stuff. There is a lesson here for filter writers: don't ignore data. You'd think this lesson would be too obvious to mention, but I've had to learn it several times. Third, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced e.g. both ``mailing'' and ``mailed'' to the root ``mail''. They may have felt they were forced to do this by the small size of their corpus, but if so this is a kind of premature optimization. Fourth, they calculated probabilities differently. They used all the tokens, whereas I only use the 15 most significant. If you use all the tokens you'll tend to miss longer spams, the type where someone tells you their life story up to the point where they got rich from some multilevel marketing scheme. And such an algorithm would be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a big chunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms. Finally, they didn't bias against false positives. I think any spam filtering algorithm ought to have a convenient knob you can twist to decrease the false positive rate at the expense of the filtering rate. I do this by counting the occurrences of tokens in the nonspam corpus double. I don't think it's a good idea to treat spam filtering as a straight text classification problem. You can use text classification techniques, but solutions can and should reflect the fact that the text is email, and spam in particular. Email is not just text; it has structure. Spam filtering is not just classification, because false positives are so much worse than false negatives that you should treat them as a different kind of error. And the source of error is not just random variation, but a live human spammer working actively to defeat your filter. **Tokens** Another project I heard about after the Slashdot article was Bill Yerazunis' [CRM114](http://crm114.sourceforge.net) [5]. This is the counterexample to the design principle I just mentioned. It's a straight text classifier, but such a stunningly effective one that it manages to filter spam almost perfectly without even knowing that's what it's doing. Once I understood how CRM114 worked, it seemed inevitable that I would eventually have to move from filtering based on single words to an approach like this. But first, I thought, I'll see how far I can get with single words. And the answer is, surprisingly far. Mostly I've been working on smarter tokenization. On current spam, I've been able to achieve filtering rates that approach CRM114's. These techniques are mostly orthogonal to Bill's; an optimal solution might incorporate both. ``A Plan for Spam'' uses a very simple definition of a token. Letters, digits, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs are constituent characters, and everything else is a token separator. I also ignored case. Now I have a more complicated definition of a token: 1. Case is preserved. 2. Exclamation points are constituent characters. 3. Periods and commas are constituents if they occur between two digits. This lets me get ip addresses and prices intact. 4. A price range like $20-25 yields two tokens, $20 and $25. 5. Tokens that occur within the To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines, or within urls, get marked accordingly. E.g. ``foo'' in the Subject line becomes ``Subject*foo''. (The asterisk could be any character you don't allow as a constituent.) Such measures increase the filter's vocabulary, which makes it more discriminating. For example, in the current filter, ``free'' in the Subject line has a spam probability of 98%, whereas the same token in the body has a spam probability of only 65%. Here are some of the current probabilities [6]: Subject*FREE 0.9999 free!! 0.9999 To*free 0.9998 Subject*free 0.9782 free! 0.9199 Free 0.9198 Url*free 0.9091 FREE 0.8747 From*free 0.7636 free 0.6546 In the Plan for Spam filter, all these tokens would have had the same probability, .7602. That filter recognized about 23,000 tokens. The current one recognizes about 187,000. The disadvantage of having a larger universe of tokens is that there is more chance of misses. Spreading your corpus out over more tokens has the same effect as making it smaller. If you consider exclamation points as constituents, for example, then you could end up not having a spam probability for free with seven exclamation points, even though you know that free with just two exclamation points has a probability of 99.99%. One solution to this is what I call degeneration. If you can't find an exact match for a token, treat it as if it were a less specific version. I consider terminal exclamation points, uppercase letters, and occurring in one of the five marked contexts as making a token more specific. For example, if I don't find a probability for ``Subject*free! '', I look for probabilities for ``Subject*free'', ``free! '', and ``free'', and take whichever one is farthest from .5. Here are the alternatives [7] considered if the filter sees ``FREE!!!'' in the Subject line and doesn't have a probability for it. Subject*Free!!! Subject*free!!! Subject*FREE! Subject*Free! Subject*free! Subject*FREE Subject*Free Subject*free FREE!!! Free!!! free!!! FREE! Free! free! FREE Free free If you do this, be sure to consider versions with initial caps as well as all uppercase and all lowercase. Spams tend to have more sentences in imperative mood, and in those the first word is a verb. So verbs with initial caps have higher spam probabilities than they would in all lowercase. In my filter, the spam probability of ``Act'' is 98% and for ``act'' only 62%. If you increase your filter's vocabulary, you can end up counting the same word multiple times, according to your old definition of ``same''. Logically, they're not the same token anymore. But if this still bothers you, let me add from experience that the words you seem to be counting multiple times tend to be exactly the ones you'd want to. Another effect of a larger vocabulary is that when you look at an incoming mail you find more interesting tokens, meaning those with probabilities far from .5. I use the 15 most interesting to decide if mail is spam. But you can run into a problem when you use a fixed number like this. If you find a lot of maximally interesting tokens, the result can end up being decided by whatever random factor determines the ordering of equally interesting tokens. One way to deal with this is to treat some as more interesting than others. For example, the token ``dalco'' occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never in my legitimate corpus. The token ``Url*optmails'' (meaning ``optmails'' within a url) occurs 1223 times. And yet, as I used to calculate probabilities for tokens, both would have the same spam probability, the threshold of .99. That doesn't feel right. There are theoretical arguments for giving these two tokens substantially different probabilities (Pantel and Lin do), but I haven't tried that yet. It does seem at least that if we find more than 15 tokens that only occur in one corpus or the other, we ought to give priority to the ones that occur a lot. So now there are two threshold values. For tokens that occur only in the spam corpus, the probability is .9999 if they occur more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise. Ditto at the other end of the scale for tokens found only in the legitimate corpus. I may later scale token probabilities substantially, but this tiny amount of scaling at least ensures that tokens get sorted the right way. Another possibility would be to consider not just 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certain threshold of interestingness. Steven Hauser does this in his statistical spam filter [8]. If you use a threshold, make it very high, or spammers could spoof you by packing messages with more innocent words. Finally, what should one do about html? I've tried the whole spectrum of options, from ignoring it to parsing it all. Ignoring html is a bad idea, because it's full of useful spam signs. But if you parse it all, your filter might degenerate into a mere html recognizer. The most effective approach seems to be the middle course, to notice some tokens but not others. I look at a, img, and font tags, and ignore the rest. Links and images you should certainly look at, because they contain urls. I could probably be smarter about dealing with html, but I don't think it's worth putting a lot of time into this. Spams full of html are easy to filter. The smarter spammers already avoid it. So performance in the future should not depend much on how you deal with html. **Performance** Between December 10 2002 and January 10 2003 I got about 1750 spams. Of these, 4 got through. That's a filtering rate of about 99.75%. Two of the four spams I missed got through because they happened to use words that occur often in my legitimate email. The third was one of those that exploit an insecure cgi script to send mail to third parties. They're hard to filter based just on the content because the headers are innocent and they're careful about the words they use. Even so I can usually catch them. This one squeaked by with a probability of .88, just under the threshold of .9. Of course, looking at multiple token sequences would catch it easily. ``Below is the result of your feedback form'' is an instant giveaway. The fourth spam was what I call a spam-of-the-future, because this is what I expect spam to evolve into: some completely neutral text followed by a url. In this case it was was from someone saying they had finally finished their homepage and would I go look at it. (The page was of course an ad for a porn site.) If the spammers are careful about the headers and use a fresh url, there is nothing in spam-of-the-future for filters to notice. We can of course counter by sending a crawler to look at the page. But that might not be necessary. The response rate for spam-of-the-future must be low, or everyone would be doing it. If it's low enough, it [won't pay](wfks.html) for spammers to send it, and we won't have to work too hard on filtering it. Now for the really shocking news: during that same one-month period I got _three_ false positives. In a way it's a relief to get some false positives. When I wrote ``A Plan for Spam'' I hadn't had any, and I didn't know what they'd be like. Now that I've had a few, I'm relieved to find they're not as bad as I feared. False positives yielded by statistical filters turn out to be mails that sound a lot like spam, and these tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9]. Two of the false positives were newsletters from companies I've bought things from. I never asked to receive them, so arguably they were spams, but I count them as false positives because I hadn't been deleting them as spams before. The reason the filters caught them was that both companies in January switched to commercial email senders instead of sending the mails from their own servers, and both the headers and the bodies became much spammier. The third false positive was a bad one, though. It was from someone in Egypt and written in all uppercase. This was a direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Plan for Spam filter wouldn't have caught it. It's hard to say what the overall false positive rate is, because we're up in the noise, statistically. Anyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) will be aware of this problem. With some emails it's hard to say whether they're spam or not, and these are the ones you end up looking at when you get filters really tight. For example, so far the filter has caught two emails that were sent to my address because of a typo, and one sent to me in the belief that I was someone else. Arguably, these are neither my spam nor my nonspam mail. Another false positive was from a vice president at Virtumundo. I wrote to them pretending to be a customer, and since the reply came back through Virtumundo's mail servers it had the most incriminating headers imaginable. Arguably this isn't a real false positive either, but a sort of Heisenberg uncertainty effect: I only got it because I was writing about spam filtering. Not counting these, I've had a total of five false positives so far, out of about 7740 legitimate emails, a rate of .06%. The other two were a notice that something I bought was back-ordered, and a party reminder from Evite. I don't think this number can be trusted, partly because the sample is so small, and partly because I think I can fix the filter not to catch some of these. False positives seem to me a different kind of error from false negatives. Filtering rate is a measure of performance. False positives I consider more like bugs. I approach improving the filtering rate as optimization, and decreasing false positives as debugging. So these five false positives are my bug list. For example, the mail from Egypt got nailed because the uppercase text made it look to the filter like a Nigerian spam. This really is kind of a bug. As with html, the email being all uppercase is really conceptually _one_ feature, not one for each word. I need to handle case in a more sophisticated way. So what to make of this .06%? Not much, I think. You could treat it as an upper bound, bearing in mind the small sample size. But at this stage it is more a measure of the bugs in my implementation than some intrinsic false positive rate of Bayesian filtering. **Future** What next? Filtering is an optimization problem, and the key to optimization is profiling. Don't try to guess where your code is slow, because you'll guess wrong. _Look_ at where your code is slow, and fix that. In filtering, this translates to: look at the spams you miss, and figure out what you could have done to catch them. For example, spammers are now working aggressively to evade filters, and one of the things they're doing is breaking up and misspelling words to prevent filters from recognizing them. But working on this is not my first priority, because I still have no trouble catching these spams [10]. There are two kinds of spams I currently do have trouble with. One is the type that pretends to be an email from a woman inviting you to go chat with her or see her profile on a dating site. These get through because they're the one type of sales pitch you can make without using sales talk. They use the same vocabulary as ordinary email. The other kind of spams I have trouble filtering are those from companies in e.g. Bulgaria offering contract programming services. These get through because I'm a programmer too, and the spams are full of the same words as my real mail. I'll probably focus on the personal ad type first. I think if I look closer I'll be able to find statistical differences between these and my real mail. The style of writing is certainly different, though it may take multiword filtering to catch that. Also, I notice they tend to repeat the url, and someone including a url in a legitimate mail wouldn't do that [11]. The outsourcing type are going to be hard to catch. Even if you sent a crawler to the site, you wouldn't find a smoking statistical gun. Maybe the only answer is a central list of domains advertised in spams [12]. But there can't be that many of this type of mail. If the only spams left were unsolicited offers of contract programming services from Bulgaria, we could all probably move on to working on something else. Will statistical filtering actually get us to that point? I don't know. Right now, for me personally, spam is not a problem. But spammers haven't yet made a serious effort to spoof statistical filters. What will happen when they do? I'm not optimistic about filters that work at the network level [13]. When there is a static obstacle worth getting past, spammers are pretty efficient at getting past it. There is already a company called Assurance Systems that will run your mail through Spamassassin and tell you whether it will get filtered out. Network-level filters won't be completely useless. They may be enough to kill all the \"opt-in\" spam, meaning spam from companies like Virtumundo and Equalamail who claim that they're really running opt-in lists. You can filter those based just on the headers, no matter what they say in the body. But anyone willing to falsify headers or use open relays, presumably including most porn spammers, should be able to get some message past network-level filters if they want to. (By no means the message they'd like to send though, which is something.) The kind of filters I'm optimistic about are ones that calculate probabilities based on each individual user's mail. These can be much more effective, not only in avoiding false positives, but in filtering too: for example, finding the recipient's email address base-64 encoded anywhere in a message is a very good spam indicator. But the real advantage of individual filters is that they'll all be different. If everyone's filters have different probabilities, it will make the spammers' optimization loop, what programmers would call their edit-compile-test cycle, appallingly slow. Instead of just tweaking a spam till it gets through a copy of some filter they have on their desktop, they'll have to do a test mailing for each tweak. It would be like programming in a language without an interactive toplevel, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. **Notes** [1] Paul Graham. ``A Plan for Spam.'' August 2002. http://paulgraham.com/spam.html. Probabilities in this algorithm are calculated using a degenerate case of Bayes' Rule. There are two simplifying assumptions: that the probabilities of features (i.e. words) are independent, and that we know nothing about the prior probability of an email being spam. The first assumption is widespread in text classification. Algorithms that use it are called ``naive Bayesian.'' The second assumption I made because the proportion of spam in my incoming mail fluctuated so much from day to day (indeed, from hour to hour) that the overall prior ratio seemed worthless as a predictor. If you assume that P(spam) and P(nonspam) are both .5, they cancel out and you can remove them from the formula. If you were doing Bayesian filtering in a situation where the ratio of spam to nonspam was consistently very high or (especially) very low, you could probably improve filter performance by incorporating prior probabilities. To do this right you'd have to track ratios by time of day, because spam and legitimate mail volume both have distinct daily patterns.

[4] At the time I had zero false positives out of about 4,000 legitimate emails. If the next legitimate email was a false positive, this would give us .03%. These false positive rates are untrustworthy, as I explain later. I quote a number here only to emphasize that whatever the false positive rate is, it is less than 1.16%. [5] Bill Yerazunis. ``Sparse Binary Polynomial Hash Message Filtering and The CRM114 Discriminator.'' Proceedings of 2003 Spam Conference. [6] In ``A Plan for Spam'' I used thresholds of .99 and .01. It seems justifiable to use thresholds proportionate to the size of the corpora. Since I now have on the order of 10,000 of each type of mail, I use .9999 and .0001. [7] There is a flaw here I should probably fix. Currently, when ``Subject*foo'' degenerates to just ``foo'', what that means is you're getting the stats for occurrences of ``foo'' in the body or header lines other than those I mark. What I should do is keep track of statistics for ``foo'' overall as well as specific versions, and degenerate from ``Subject*foo'' not to ``foo'' but to ``Anywhere*foo''. Ditto for case: I should degenerate from uppercase to any-case, not lowercase. It would probably be a win to do this with prices too, e.g. to degenerate from ``$129.99'' to ``$--9.99'', ``$--.99'', and ``$--''. You could also degenerate from words to their stems, but this would probably only improve filtering rates early on when you had small corpora. [8] Steven Hauser. ``Statistical Spam Filter Works for Me.'' http://www.sofbot.com. [9] False positives are not all equal, and we should remember this when comparing techniques for stopping spam. Whereas many of the false positives caused by filters will be near-spams that you wouldn't mind missing, false positives caused by blacklists, for example, will be just mail from people who chose the wrong ISP. In both cases you catch mail that's near spam, but for blacklists nearness is physical, and for filters it's textual. [10] If spammers get good enough at obscuring tokens for this to be a problem, we can respond by simply removing whitespace, periods, commas, etc. and using a dictionary to pick the words out of the resulting sequence. And of course finding words this way that weren't visible in the original text would in itself be evidence of spam. Picking out the words won't be trivial. It will require more than just reconstructing word boundaries; spammers both add (``xHot nPorn cSite'') and omit (``P#rn'') letters. Vision research may be useful here, since human vision is the limit that such tricks will approach. [11] In general, spams are more repetitive than regular email. They want to pound that message home. I currently don't allow duplicates in the top 15 tokens, because you could get a false positive if the sender happens to use some bad word multiple times. (In my current filter, ``dick'' has a spam probabilty of .9999, but it's also a name.) It seems we should at least notice duplication though, so I may try allowing up to two of each token, as Brian Burton does in SpamProbe. [12] This is what approaches like Brightmail's will degenerate into once spammers are pushed into using mad-lib techniques to generate everything else in the message. [13] It's sometimes argued that we should be working on filtering at the network level, because it is more efficient. What people usually mean when they say this is: we currently filter at the network level, and we don't want to start over from scratch. But you can't dictate the problem to fit your solution. Historically, scarce-resource arguments have been the losing side in debates about software design. People only tend to use them to justify choices (inaction in particular) made for other reasons. **Thanks** to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, and Dan Giffin for reading drafts of this paper, and to Dan again for most of the infrastructure that this filter runs on. **Related:** **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). April 2005 This summer, as an experiment, some friends and I are giving [seed funding](http://ycombinator.com) to a bunch of new startups. It's an experiment because we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would. That's why we're doing it during the summer—so even college students can participate. We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful startups. And we know from experience that some undergrads are as capable as most grad students. The accepted age for startup founders has been creeping downward. We're trying to find the lower bound. The deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications. We expected to divide them into two categories, promising and unpromising. But we soon saw we needed a third: promising people with unpromising ideas. [1] **The Artix Phase** We should have expected this. It's very common for a group of founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves did. Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started. In January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called Artix. The plan was to put art galleries on the Web. In retrospect, I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid. Galleries are not especially [excited](http://www.knoedlergallery.com/) about being on the Web even now, ten years later. They don't want to have their stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store. [2] Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on earth. They didn't become art dealers after a difficult choice between that and a career in the hard sciences. Most of them had never seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should be on it. Some didn't even have computers. It doesn't do justice to the situation to describe it as a hard _sell_ ; we soon sank to building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries even to do that. Gradually it dawned on us that instead of trying to make Web sites for people who didn't want them, we could make sites for people who did. In fact, software that would let people who wanted sites make their own. So we ditched Artix and started a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores. That one succeeded. We're in good company here. Microsoft was not the first company Paul Allen and Bill Gates started either. The first was called Traf-o-data. It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft. In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix. I dragged him into it. [3] But there were moments when he was optimistic. And if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money. **The Still Life Effect** Why does this happen? Why do good hackers have bad business ideas? Let's look at our case. One reason we had such a lame idea was that it was the first thing we thought of. I was in New York trying to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually quite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway. When I learned about the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two. Make Web sites for galleries—that's the ticket! If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head. You'd think. But people don't. In fact, this is a constant problem when you're painting still lifes. You plonk down a bunch of stuff on a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to look interesting. But you're so impatient to get started painting that ten minutes of rearranging feels very long. So you start painting. Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring at it, you're kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and boring composition, but by then it's too late. Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small ones. You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you have a spare hour, and days later you're still working on it. I once spent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up in about four minutes. At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought I'd already put in so much time that it was too late to change. So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect: you come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point (a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that this must be _the_ idea. How do we fix that? I don't think we should discard plunging. Plunging into an idea is a good thing. The solution is at the other end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make it good. This is clearest in the case of names. Viaweb was originally called Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product called that. We were so attached to our name that we offered him _5% of the company_ if he'd let us have it. But he wouldn't, so we had to think of another. [4] The best we could do was Viaweb, which we disliked at first. It was like having a new mother. But within three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame and old-fashioned. If it's hard to change something so simple as a name, imagine how hard it is to garbage-collect an idea. A name only has one point of attachment into your head. An idea for a company gets woven into your thoughts. So you must consciously discount for that. Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your idea in the harsh light of morning and ask: is this something people will pay for? Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing people will pay most for? **Muck** The second mistake we made with Artix is also very common. Putting galleries on the Web seemed cool. One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass. Meaning that unpleasant work pays. And more to the point here, vice versa. Work people like doesn't pay well, for reasons of supply and demand. The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which doesn't pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for free. When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business. I wanted to keep one foot in the art world. Big, big, mistake. Going into business is like a hang-glider launch: you'd better do it wholeheartedly, or not at all. The purpose of a company, and a startup especially, is to make money. You can't have divided loyalties. Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort of work, like spamming, or starting a company whose only purpose is patent litigation. What I mean is, if you're starting a company that will do something cool, the aim had better be to make money and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money. It's hard enough to make money that you can't do it by accident. Unless it's your first priority, it's unlikely to happen at all. **Hyenas** When I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity. If you'd proposed at the time that we go into the e-commerce business, we'd have found the idea terrifying. Surely a field like that would be dominated by fearsome startups with five million dollars of VC money each. Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our own in the slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites for art galleries. We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety. As it turns out, VC-backed startups are not that fearsome. They're too busy trying to spend all that [money](venturecapital.html) to get software written. In 1995, the e-commerce business was very competitive as measured in press releases, but not as measured in software. And really it never was. The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were just consulting companies pretending to be product companies [5], and the offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred lines of Perl scripts. Or could have been implemented as a couple hundred lines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of lines of C++ or Java. Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce, it turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete. So why were we afraid? We felt we were good at programming, but we lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated thing we called \"business.\" In fact there is no such thing as \"business.\" There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising money, and so on. And the combination is not as hard as it seems, because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated) are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you're big or small, and others (like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination than any kind of special training. Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because we were afraid of the lions. Except the lions turned out not to have any teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barely qualified as carrion. **A Familiar Problem** Sum up all these sources of error, and it's no wonder we had such a bad idea for a company. We did the first thing we thought of; we were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberately chose an impoverished market to avoid competition. Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I see signs of all three. But the first is by far the biggest problem. Most of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the things we could do, is _this_ the one with the best chance of making money? If they'd already been through their Artix phase, they'd have learned to ask that. After the reception we got from art dealers, we were ready to. This time, we thought, let's make something people want. Reading the _Wall Street Journal_ for a week should give anyone ideas for two or three new startups. The articles are full of descriptions of problems that need to be solved. But most of the applicants don't seem to have looked far for ideas. We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games. We were not far off: this was the second most common. The most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar, a dating site, and Friendster. Maybe there is some new killer app to be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking around in this fog when there are valuable, unsolved problems lying about in the open for anyone to see. Why did no one propose a new scheme for micropayments? An ambitious project, perhaps, but I can't believe we've considered every alternative. And newspapers and magazines are (literally) dying for a solution. Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want? I think the problem with many, as with people in their early twenties generally, is that they've been trained their whole lives to jump through predefined hoops. They've spent 15-20 years solving problems other people have set for them. And how much time deciding what problems would be good to solve? Two or three course projects? They're good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them. But that, I'm convinced, is just the effect of training. Or more precisely, the effect of grading. To make grading efficient, everyone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has to be decided in advance. It would be great if schools taught students how to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don't know how you'd run such a class in practice. **Copper and Tin** The good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned. I know that from experience. Hackers can learn to make things customers want. [6] This is a controversial view. One expert on \"entrepreneurship\" told me that any startup had to include business people, because only they could focus on what customers wanted. I'll probably alienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it, because his email was such a perfect example of this view: > 80% of MIT spinoffs succeed _provided_ they have at least one management > person in the team at the start. The business person represents the \"voice > of the customer\" and that's what keeps the engineers and product development > on track. This is, in my opinion, a crock. Hackers are perfectly capable of hearing the voice of the customer without a business person to amplify the signal for them. Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad students in computer science, which presumably makes them \"engineers.\" Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some business guy whispering in their ears what customers wanted? It seems to me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting started. The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring out that you need to figure it out. But that's something you can learn quickly. It's like seeing the other interpretation of an ambiguous picture. As soon as someone tells you there's a rabbit as well as a duck, it's hard not to see it. And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving, giving customers what they want is easy. Anyone who can write an optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn't confuse users, once they _choose_ to focus on that problem. And once you apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions, you can create wealth very rapidly. That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that's beneath them. Big companies try to hire the right person for the job. Startups win because they don't—because they take people so smart that they would in a big company be doing \"research,\" and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think Einstein designing refrigerators. [7] If you want to learn what people want, read Dale Carnegie's _How to Win Friends and Influence People._ [8] When a friend recommended this book, I couldn't believe he was serious. But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was right. It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience: how to see things from other people's point of view, instead of thinking only of yourself. Most smart people don't do that very well. But adding this ability to raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper. The result is bronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal. A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful. And not just at making money: look what a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox. Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in the same way that not drinking anything would teach you how much you depend on water. But it would be more convenient for all involved if the Summer Founders didn't learn this on our dime—if they could skip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customers wanted. That, I think, is going to be the real experiment this summer. How long will it take them to grasp this? We decided we ought to have T-Shirts for the SFP, and we'd been thinking about what to print on the back. Till now we'd been planning to use > If you can read this, I should be working. but now we've decided it's going to be > Make something people want. **Notes** [1] SFP applicants: please don't assume that not being accepted means we think your idea is bad. Because we want to keep the number of startups small this first summer, we're going to have to turn down some good proposals too. [2] Dealers try to give each customer the impression that the stuff they're showing him is something special that only a few people have seen, when in fact it may have been sitting in their racks for years while they tried to unload it on buyer after buyer. [3] On the other hand, he was skeptical about Viaweb too. I have a precise measure of that, because at one point in the first couple months we made a bet: if he ever made a million dollars out of Viaweb, he'd get his ear pierced. We didn't let him [off](pierced.html), either. [4] I wrote a program to generate all the combinations of \"Web\" plus a three letter word. I learned from this that most three letter words are bad: Webpig, Webdog, Webfat, Webzit, Webfug. But one of them was Webvia; I swapped them to make Viaweb. [5] It's much easier to sell services than a product, just as it's easier to make a living playing at weddings than by selling recordings. But the margins are greater on products. So during the Bubble a lot of companies used consulting to generate revenues they could attribute to the sale of products, because it made a better story for an IPO. [6] Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: \"Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution.\" [7] You need to offer especially large rewards to get great people to do tedious work. That's why startups always pay equity rather than just salary.

The original edition contained a few unPC ideas, but it's always better to read an original book, bearing in mind that it's a book from a past era, than to read a new version sanitized for your protection. **Thanks** to Bill Birch, Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. September 2004 _(This essay is derived from an invited talk at ICFP 2004. )_ I had a front row seat for the Internet Bubble, because I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999. One day, when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated what I thought the price should be. The answer I got was $12. I went to the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor. \"Twelve!\" he said. He tried to sound indignant, but he didn't quite manage it. He knew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy. Yahoo was a special case. It was not just our price to earnings ratio that was bogus. Half our earnings were too. Not in the Enron way, of course. The finance guys seemed scrupulous about reporting earnings. What made our earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of a Ponzi scheme. Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings and said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make money. So they invested in new startups that promised to be the next Yahoo. And as soon as these startups got the money, what did they do with it? Buy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote their brand. Result: a capital investment in a startup this quarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter—stimulating another round of investments in startups. As in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this system were simply the latest round of investments in it. What made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional. At least, I think it was. The venture capital business is pretty incestuous, and there were presumably people in a position, if not to create this situation, to realize what was happening and to milk it. A year later the game was up. Starting in January 2000, Yahoo's stock price began to crash, ultimately losing 95% of its value. Notice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its market cap, Yahoo was still worth a lot. Even at the morning-after valuations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had managed to create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years. The fact is, despite all the nonsense we heard during the Bubble about the \"new economy,\" there was a core of truth. You need that to get a really big bubble: you need to have something solid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in. (Isaac Newton and Jonathan Swift both lost money in the South Sea Bubble of 1720.) Now the pendulum has swung the other way. Now anything that became fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable. But that's a mistake—an even bigger mistake than believing what everyone was saying in 1999. Over the long term, what the Bubble got right will be more important than what it got wrong. **1\\. Retail VC** After the excesses of the Bubble, it's now considered dubious to take companies public before they have earnings. But there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that idea. Taking a company public at an early stage is simply retail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last round of funding, you go to the public markets. By the end of the Bubble, companies going public with no earnings were being derided as \"concept stocks,\" as if it were inherently stupid to invest in them. But investing in concepts isn't stupid; it's what VCs do, and the best of them are far from stupid. The stock of a company that doesn't yet have earnings is worth _something._ It may take a while for the market to learn how to value such companies, just as it had to learn to value common stocks in the early 20th century. But markets are good at solving that kind of problem. I wouldn't be surprised if the market ultimately did a better job than VCs do now. Going public early will not be the right plan for every company. And it can of course be disruptive—by distracting the management, or by making the early employees suddenly rich. But just as the market will learn how to value startups, startups will learn how to minimize the damage of going public. **2\\. The Internet** The Internet genuinely is a big deal. That was one reason even smart people were fooled by the Bubble. Obviously it was going to have a huge effect. Enough of an effect to triple the value of Nasdaq companies in two years? No, as it turned out. But it was hard to say for certain at the time. [1] The same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles. What drove them was the invention of organized public finance (the South Sea Company, despite its name, was really a competitor of the Bank of England). And that did turn out to be a big deal, in the long run. Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than figuring out how to profit from it. The mistake investors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally. Since the Internet was the big new thing, investors supposed that the more Internettish the company, the better. Hence such parodies as Pets.Com. In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made indirectly. It was not the railroads themselves that made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies on either side, like Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails, and Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast, where it could be shipped to Europe. I think the Internet will have great effects, and that what we've seen so far is nothing compared to what's coming. But most of the winners will only indirectly be Internet companies; for every Google there will be ten JetBlues. **3\\. Choices** Why will the Internet have great effects? The general argument is that new forms of communication always do. They happen rarely (till industrial times there were just speech, writing, and printing), but when they do, they always cause a big splash. The specific argument, or one of them, is the Internet gives us more choices. In the \"old\" economy, the high cost of presenting information to people meant they had only a narrow range of options to choose from. The tiny, expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named \"the channel.\" Control the channel and you could feed them what you wanted, on your terms. And it was not just big corporations that depended on this principle. So, in their way, did labor unions, the traditional news media, and the art and literary establishments. Winning depended not on doing good work, but on gaining control of some bottleneck. There are signs that this is changing. Google has over 82 million unique users a month and annual revenues of about three billion dollars. [2] And yet have you ever seen a Google ad? Something is going on here. Admittedly, Google is an extreme case. It's very easy for people to switch to a new search engine. It costs little effort and no money to try a new one, and it's easy to see if the results are better. And so Google doesn't _have_ to advertise. In a business like theirs, being the best is enough. The exciting thing about the Internet is that it's shifting everything in that direction. The hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff, is the beginning. Eventually everyone will learn by word of mouth that you're the best, but how do you survive to that point? And it is in this crucial stage that the Internet has the most effect. First, the Internet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost. Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which reputation spreads by word of mouth. Together these mean that in many fields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come. Make something great and put it online. That is a big change from the recipe for winning in the past century. **4\\. Youth** The aspect of the Internet Bubble that the press seemed most taken with was the youth of some of the startup founders. This too is a trend that will last. There is a huge standard deviation among 26 year olds. Some are fit only for entry level jobs, but others are ready to rule the world if they can find someone to handle the paperwork for them. A 26 year old may not be very good at managing people or dealing with the SEC. Those require experience. But those are also commodities, which can be handed off to some lieutenant. The most important quality in a CEO is his vision for the company's future. What will they build next? And in that department, there are 26 year olds who can compete with anyone. In 1970 a company president meant someone in his fifties, at least. If he had technologists working for him, they were treated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful. But as technology has grown more important, the power of nerds has grown to reflect it. Now it's not enough for a CEO to have someone smart he can ask about technical matters. Increasingly, he has to be that person himself. As always, business has clung to old forms. VCs still seem to want to install a legitimate-looking talking head as the CEO. But increasingly the founders of the company are the real powers, and the grey-headed man installed by the VCs more like a music group's manager than a general. **5\\. Informality** In New York, the Bubble had dramatic consequences: suits went out of fashion. They made one seem old. So in 1998 powerful New York types were suddenly wearing open-necked shirts and khakis and oval wire-rimmed glasses, just like guys in Santa Clara. The pendulum has swung back a bit, driven in part by a panicked reaction by the clothing industry. But I'm betting on the open-necked shirts. And this is not as frivolous a question as it might seem. Clothes are important, as all nerds can sense, though they may not realize it consciously. If you're a nerd, you can understand how important clothes are by asking yourself how you'd feel about a company that made you wear a suit and tie to work. The idea sounds horrible, doesn't it? In fact, horrible far out of proportion to the mere discomfort of wearing such clothes. A company that made programmers wear suits would have something deeply wrong with it. And what would be wrong would be that how one presented oneself counted more than the quality of one's ideas. _That's_ the problem with formality. Dressing up is not so much bad in itself. The problem is the receptor it binds to: dressing up is inevitably a substitute for good ideas. It is no coincidence that technically inept business types are known as \"suits.\" Nerds don't just happen to dress informally. They do it too consistently. Consciously or not, they dress informally as a prophylactic measure against stupidity. **6\\. Nerds** Clothing is only the most visible battleground in the war against formality. Nerds tend to eschew formality of any sort. They're not impressed by one's job title, for example, or any of the other appurtenances of authority. Indeed, that's practically the definition of a nerd. I found myself talking recently to someone from Hollywood who was planning a show about nerds. I thought it would be useful if I explained what a nerd was. What I came up with was: someone who doesn't expend any effort on marketing himself. A nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance. So what's the connection between nerds and technology? Roughly that you can't fool mother nature. In technical matters, you have to get the right answers. If your software miscalculates the path of a space probe, you can't finesse your way out of trouble by saying that your code is patriotic, or avant-garde, or any of the other dodges people use in nontechnical fields. And as technology becomes increasingly important in the economy, nerd culture is [rising](nerdad.html) with it. Nerds are already a lot cooler than they were when I was a kid. When I was in college in the mid-1980s, \"nerd\" was still an insult. People who majored in computer science generally tried to conceal it. Now women ask me where they can meet nerds. (The answer that springs to mind is \"Usenix,\" but that would be like drinking from a firehose.) I have no illusions about why nerd culture is becoming more accepted. It's not because people are realizing that substance is more important than marketing. It's because the nerds are getting rich. But that is not going to change. **7\\. Options** What makes the nerds rich, usually, is stock options. Now there are moves afoot to make it harder for companies to grant options. To the extent there's some genuine accounting abuse going on, by all means correct it. But don't kill the golden goose. Equity is the fuel that drives technical innovation. Options are a good idea because (a) they're fair, and (b) they work. Someone who goes to work for a company is (one hopes) adding to its value, and it's only fair to give them a share of it. And as a purely practical measure, people work a _lot_ harder when they have options. I've seen that first hand. The fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed their companies by granting themselves options doesn't mean options are a bad idea. During the railroad boom, some executives enriched themselves by selling watered stock—by issuing more shares than they said were outstanding. But that doesn't make common stock a bad idea. Crooks just use whatever means are available. If there is a problem with options, it's that they reward slightly the wrong thing. Not surprisingly, people do what you pay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they'll work a lot of hours. If you pay them by the volume of work done, they'll get a lot of work done (but only as you defined work). And if you pay them to raise the stock price, which is what options amount to, they'll raise the stock price. But that's not quite what you want. What you want is to increase the actual value of the company, not its market cap. Over time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quickly as options vest. Which means options tempt employees, if only unconsciously, to \"pump and dump\"—to do things that will make the company _seem_ valuable. I found that when I was at Yahoo, I couldn't help thinking, \"how will this sound to investors?\" when I should have been thinking \"is this a good idea?\" So maybe the standard option deal needs to be tweaked slightly. Maybe options should be replaced with something tied more directly to earnings. It's still early days. **8\\. Startups** What made the options valuable, for the most part, is that they were options on the stock of [startups](start.html). Startups were not of course a creation of the Bubble, but they were more visible during the Bubble than ever before. One thing most people did learn about for the first time during the Bubble was the startup created with the intention of selling it. Originally a startup meant a small company that hoped to grow into a big one. But increasingly startups are evolving into a vehicle for developing technology on spec. As I wrote in [Hackers & Painters](hackpaint.html), employees seem to be most productive when they're paid in proportion to the wealth they generate. And the advantage of a startup—indeed, almost its raison d'etre—is that it offers something otherwise impossible to obtain: a way of _measuring_ that. In many businesses, it just makes more sense for companies to get technology by buying startups rather than developing it in house. You pay more, but there is less risk, and risk is what big companies don't want. It makes the guys developing the technology more accountable, because they only get paid if they build the winner. And you end up with better technology, created faster, because things are made in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of the bureaucratic atmosphere of big companies. Our startup, Viaweb, was built to be sold. We were open with investors about that from the start. And we were careful to create something that could slot easily into a larger company. That is the pattern for the future. **9\\. California** The Bubble was a California phenomenon. When I showed up in Silicon Valley in 1998, I felt like an immigrant from Eastern Europe arriving in America in 1900. Everyone was so cheerful and healthy and rich. It seemed a new and improved world. The press, ever eager to exaggerate small trends, now gives one the impression that Silicon Valley is a ghost town. Not at all. When I drive down 101 from the airport, I still feel a buzz of energy, as if there were a giant transformer nearby. Real estate is still more expensive than just about anywhere else in the country. The people still look healthy, and the weather is still fabulous. The future is there. (I say \"there\" because I moved back to the East Coast after Yahoo. I still wonder if this was a smart idea.) What makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of the people. I notice that when I come home to Boston. The first thing I see when I walk out of the airline terminal is the fat, grumpy guy in charge of the taxi line. I brace myself for rudeness: _remember, you're back on the East Coast now._ The atmosphere varies from city to city, and fragile organisms like startups are exceedingly sensitive to such variation. If it hadn't already been hijacked as a new euphemism for liberal, the word to describe the atmosphere in the Bay Area would be \"progressive.\" People there are trying to build the future. Boston has MIT and Harvard, but it also has a lot of truculent, unionized employees like the police who recently held the Democratic National Convention for [ransom](http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-04-30-boston- police-convention_x.htm), and a lot of people trying to be Thurston Howell. Two sides of an obsolete coin. Silicon Valley may not be the next Paris or London, but it is at least the next Chicago. For the next fifty years, that's where new wealth will come from. **10\\. Productivity** During the Bubble, optimistic analysts used to justify high price to earnings ratios by saying that technology was going to increase productivity dramatically. They were wrong about the specific companies, but not so wrong about the underlying principle. I think one of the big trends we'll see in the coming century is a huge increase in productivity. Or more precisely, a huge increase in [variation](gh.html) in productivity. Technology is a lever. It doesn't add; it multiplies. If the present range of productivity is 0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 increases the range from 0 to 1000. One upshot of which is that the companies of the future may be surprisingly small. I sometimes daydream about how big you could grow a company (in revenues) without ever having more than ten people. What would happen if you outsourced everything except product development? If you tried this experiment, I think you'd be surprised at how far you could get. As Fred Brooks pointed out, small groups are intrinsically more productive, because the internal friction in a group grows as the square of its size. Till quite recently, running a major company meant managing an army of workers. Our standards about how many employees a company should have are still influenced by old patterns. Startups are perforce small, because they can't afford to hire a lot of people. But I think it's a big mistake for companies to loosen their belts as revenues increase. The question is not whether you can afford the extra salaries. Can you afford the loss in productivity that comes from making the company bigger? The prospect of technological leverage will of course raise the specter of unemployment. I'm surprised people still worry about this. After centuries of supposedly job-killing innovations, the number of jobs is within ten percent of the number of people who want them. This can't be a coincidence. There must be some kind of balancing mechanism. **What's New** When one looks over these trends, is there any overall theme? There does seem to be: that in the coming century, good ideas will count for more. That 26 year olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50 year olds with powerful connections. That doing good work will matter more than dressing up—or advertising, which is the same thing for companies. That people will be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what they create. If so, this is good news indeed. Good ideas always tend to win eventually. The problem is, it can take a very long time. It took decades for relativity to be accepted, and the greater part of a century to establish that central planning didn't work. So even a small increase in the rate at which good ideas win would be a momentous change—big enough, probably, to justify a name like the \"new economy.\" **Notes** [1] Actually it's hard to say now. As Jeremy Siegel points out, if the value of a stock is its future earnings, you can't tell if it was overvalued till you see what the earnings turn out to be. While certain famous Internet stocks were almost certainly overvalued in 1999, it is still hard to say for sure whether, e.g., the Nasdaq index was. Siegel, Jeremy J. \"What Is an Asset Price Bubble? An Operational Definition.\" _European Financial Management,_ 9:1, 2003. [2] The number of users comes from a 6/03 Nielsen study quoted on Google's site. (You'd think they'd have something more recent.) The revenue estimate is based on revenues of $1.35 billion for the first half of 2004, as reported in their IPO filing. **Thanks** to Chris Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. November 2004, corrected June 2006 Occam's razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations. I begin by reminding readers of this principle because I'm about to propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives. But Occam's razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagree with it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain. Theory: In US presidential elections, the more charismatic candidate wins. People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right, have a consistent bias: they take politics seriously. When one candidate beats another they look for political explanations. The country is shifting to the left, or the right. And that sort of shift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, which makes it easy to believe it was the cause. But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George Bush, it wasn't because I was shifting to the left. Clinton just seemed more dynamic. He seemed to want the job more. Bush seemed old and tired. I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters. Clinton didn't represent any national shift leftward. [1] He was just more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole. In 2000 we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it: Gore had Clinton's policies, but not his charisma, and he suffered proportionally. [2] Same story in 2004. Kerry was smarter and more articulate than Bush, but rather a stiff. And Kerry lost. As I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern. Pundits said Carter beat Ford because the country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate. And yet it also happened that Carter was famous for his big grin and folksy ways, and Ford for being a boring klutz. Four years later, pundits said the country had lurched to the right. But Reagan, a former actor, also happened to be even more charismatic than Carter (whose grin was somewhat less cheery after four stressful years in office). In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan and Mondale was like that between Clinton and Dole, with similar results. The first George Bush managed to win in 1988, though he would later be vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, because in 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismatic Michael Dukakis. These are the elections I remember personally, but apparently the same pattern played out in 1964 and 1972. The most recent counterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic Hubert Humphrey. But when you examine that election, it tends to support the charisma theory more than contradict it. As Joe McGinnis recounts in his famous book _The Selling of the President 1968_ , Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simply refused to debate him on TV. He knew he couldn't afford to let the two of them be seen side by side. Now a candidate probably couldn't get away with refusing to debate. But in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving. In effect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to see the real Nixon. All they saw were carefully scripted campaign spots. Oddly enough, the most recent true counterexample is probably 1960. Though this election is usually given as an example of the power of TV, Kennedy apparently would not have won without fraud by party machines in Illinois and Texas. But TV was still young in 1960; only 87% of households had it. [3] Undoubtedly TV helped Kennedy, so historians are correct in regarding this election as a watershed. TV required a new kind of candidate. There would be no more Calvin Coolidges. The charisma theory may also explain why Democrats tend to lose presidential elections. The core of the Democrats' ideology seems to be a belief in government. Perhaps this tends to attract people who are earnest, but dull. Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similar in that respect that they might have been brothers. Good thing for the Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton, even if some scandal results. [4] One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, if only fake ones like Willie Horton. And yet, if they are, we have a remarkable coincidence to explain. In every presidential election since TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate has won. Surprising, isn't it, that voters' opinions on the issues have lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row? The political commentators who come up with shifts to the left or right in their morning-after analyses are like the financial reporters stuck writing stories day after day about the random fluctuations of the stock market. Day ends, market closes up or down, reporter looks for good or bad news respectively, and writes that the market was up on news of Intel's earnings, or down on fears of instability in the Middle East. Suppose we could somehow feed these reporters false information about market closes, but give them all the other news intact. Does anyone believe they would notice the anomaly, and not simply write that stocks were up (or down) on whatever good (or bad) news there was that day? That they would say, hey, wait a minute, how can stocks be up with all this unrest in the Middle East? I'm not saying that issues don't matter to voters. Of course they do. But the major parties know so well which issues matter how much to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely in response, that they tend to split the difference on the issues, leaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can't control: charisma. If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic as Clinton in the 2004 election, he'd have won. And we'd be reading that the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead of that the Democrats are out of touch with evangelical Christians in middle America. During the 1992 election, the Clinton campaign staff had a big sign in their office saying \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Perhaps it was even simpler than they thought. **Postscript** Opinions seem to be divided about the charisma theory. Some say it's impossible, others say it's obvious. This seems a good sign. Perhaps it's in the sweet spot midway between. As for it being impossible, I reply: here's the data; here's the theory; theory explains data 100%. To a scientist, at least, that means it deserves attention, however implausible it seems. You can't believe voters are so superficial that they just choose the most charismatic guy? My theory doesn't require that. I'm not proposing that charisma is the only factor, just that it's the only one _left_ after the efforts of the two parties cancel one another out. As for the theory being obvious, as far as I know, no one has proposed it before. Election forecasters are proud when they can achieve the same results with much more complicated models. Finally, to the people who say that the theory is probably true, but rather depressing: it's not so bad as it seems. The phenomenon is like a pricing anomaly; once people realize it's there, it will disappear. Once both parties realize it's a waste of time to nominate uncharismatic candidates, they'll tend to nominate only the most charismatic ones. And if the candidates are equally charismatic, charisma will cancel out, and elections will be decided on issues, as political commentators like to think they are now. **Notes** [1] As Clinton himself discovered to his surprise when, in one of his first acts as president, he tried to shift the military leftward. After a bruising fight he escaped with a face-saving compromise. [2] True, Gore won the popular vote. But politicians know the electoral vote decides the election, so that's what they campaign for. If Bush had been campaigning for the popular vote he would presumably have got more of it. (Thanks to judgmentalist for this point.) [3] Source: Nielsen Media Research. Of the remaining 13%, 11 didn't have TV because they couldn't afford it. I'd argue that the missing 11% were probably also the 11% most susceptible to charisma. [4] One implication of this theory is that parties shouldn't be too quick to reject candidates with skeletons in their closets. Charismatic candidates will tend to have more skeletons than squeaky clean dullards, but in practice that doesn't seem to lose elections. The current Bush, for example, probably did more drugs in his twenties than any preceding president, and yet managed to get elected with a base of evangelical Christians. All you have to do is say you've reformed, and stonewall about the details. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Maria Daniels, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this, and to Eric Raymond for pointing out that I was wrong about 1968. [](http://reddit.com) [ Comment](http://reddit.com/info/8zp7/comments) on this essay. May 2008 Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder. The surprising thing is how different these messages can be. New York tells you, above all: you should make more money. There are other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You should be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be richer. What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message there is: you should be smarter. You really should get around to reading all those books you've been meaning to. When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising answers. As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful. That's not quite the same message New York sends. Power matters in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon Valley no one would care except a few real estate agents. What matters in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world. The reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically everyone. _____ How much does it matter what message a city sends? Empirically, the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend your environment. Where you live should make at most a couple percent difference. But if you look at the historical evidence, it seems to matter more than that. Most people who did great things were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was done at the time. You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about [earlier](taste.html): the case of the Milanese Leonardo. Practically every fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence, even though Milan was just as big. People in Florence weren't genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo. What happened to him? If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo couldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can? I don't. I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this force. I'd rather use it. So I've thought a lot about where to live. I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — that it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life in Berkeley is very civilized. It's probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But it's not humming with ambition. In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of life. Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge. The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident. You have to make sacrifices to live there. It's expensive and somewhat grubby, and the weather's often bad. So the kind of people you find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive, grubby place with bad weather. As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital of the world. I realize that seems a preposterous claim. What makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere else. American universities currently seem to be the best, judging from the flow of ambitious students. And what US city has a stronger claim? New York? A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a much larger number of neanderthals in suits. The Bay Area has a lot of smart people too, but again, diluted; there are two great universities, but they're far apart. Harvard and MIT are practically adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by about 20 other colleges and universities. [1] Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is ideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's is startups. _____ When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really talking about is collections of people. For a long time cities were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two ideas interchangeably. But we can see how much things are changing from the examples I've mentioned. New York is a classic great city. But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not even that. (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital of Silicon Valley. It's just 178 square miles at one end of it.) Maybe the Internet will change things further. Maybe one day the most important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and it won't matter where you live physically. But I wouldn't bet on it. The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the ways cities send you messages are quite subtle. One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see into the houses. When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening, you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs. In Cambridge you see shelves full of promising-looking books. Palo Alto was probably much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there was a university nearby. Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods in Silicon Valley. [2] A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see through windows, in conversations you overhear. It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off. One of the occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the conversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative sentences. But on average I'll take Cambridge conversations over New York or Silicon Valley ones. A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worst thing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping. At the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure, it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality eavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to live? Now I understand what she meant. The conversations you overhear tell you what sort of people you're among. _____ No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced by the people around you. It's not so much that you do whatever a city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around you cares about the same things you do. There's an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like that between gaining and losing money. Most people overvalue negative amounts of money: they'll work much harder to avoid losing a dollar than to gain one. Similarly, although there are plenty of people strong enough to resist doing something just because that's what one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are few strong enough to keep working on something no one around them cares about. Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition. The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just that there's a concentration of smart people there, but that there's nothing _else_ people there care about more. Professors in New York and the Bay area are second class citizens — till they start hedge funds or startups respectively. This suggests an answer to a question people in New York have wondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow into a startup hub to rival Silicon Valley. One reason that's unlikely is that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a second class citizen. [3] There's already something else people in New York admire more. In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York. The power of an important new technology does eventually convert to money. So by caring more about money and less about power than Silicon Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower. [4] And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game: the ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 has decreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in 1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007. _____ Not all cities send a message. Only those that are centers for some type of ambition do. And it can be hard to tell exactly what message a city sends without living there. I understand the messages of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've lived for several years in each of them. DC and LA seem to send messages too, but I haven't spent long enough in either to say for sure what they are. The big thing in LA seems to be fame. There's an A List of people who are most in demand right now, and what's most admired is to be on it, or friends with those who are. Beneath that, the message is much like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical attractiveness. In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who you know. You want to be an insider. In practice this seems to work much as in LA. There's an A List and you want to be on it or close to those who are. The only difference is how the A List is selected. And even that is not that different. At the moment, San Francisco's message seems to be the same as Berkeley's: you should live better. But this will change if enough startups choose SF over the Valley. During the Bubble that was a predictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buying expensive office furniture. Even now I'm suspicious when startups choose SF. But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self- indulgent choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift there. I haven't found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition. Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: the message is there, but not as strong. Paris was once a great intellectual center. If you went there in 1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now. But I tried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the inhabitants are not intellectual ones. The message Paris sends now is: do things with style. I liked that, actually. Paris is the only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art. In America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of the artist. But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can see that people there actually care what paintings look like. Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know. [5] There's one more message I've heard from cities: in London you can still (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic. If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and Boston. But this message is everywhere very faint. It would have been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that wavelength to see if there was any signal left. _____ So far the complete list of messages I've picked up from cities is: wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of life. My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly queasy. I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize now that was because I'd always implicitly understood it to mean ambition in the areas I cared about. When you list everything ambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so pretty. On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that are surprising in the light of history. For example, physical attractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago (though it might have been 2400 years ago). It has always mattered for women, but in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matter for men as well. I'm not sure why — probably some combination of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now: you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory, so you have to show off with your body instead. Hipness is another thing you wouldn't have seen on the list 100 years ago. Or wouldn't you? What it means is to know what's what. So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that consisted of being \"au fait.\" That could explain why hipness seems particularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the traditional English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand. Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what we mean by it is changing. It used to mean the control of vast human and material resources. But increasingly it means the ability to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a position to do that are not even rich — leaders of important open source projects, for example. The Captains of Industry of times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new technologies for them. The new breed are themselves those people. As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list: social class. I think the two changes are related. Economic power, wealth, and social class are just names for the same thing at different stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth, and wealth to social class. So the focus of admiration is simply shifting upstream. _____ Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city? No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren't the only places that do. For some kinds of work, all you need is a handful of talented colleagues. What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers. These aren't so critical in something like math or physics, where no audience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently straightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it reliably. In a field like math or physics all you need is a department with the right colleagues in it. It could be anywhere — in Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example. It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the larger environment matters. In these the best practitioners aren't conveniently collected in a few top university departments and research labs — partly because talent is harder to judge, and partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself. It's in these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city: you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city. You don't have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit from it. The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones of your career. Clearly you don't have to grow up in a great city. Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one. To most college students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough. Plus in college you don't yet have to face the hardest kind of work — discovering new problems to solve. It's when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps most to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement. You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've found both. The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all over France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over France, but what defined them were the years they spent together in Paris. _____ Unless you're sure what you want to do and where the leading center for it is, your best bet is probably to try living in several places when you're young. You can never tell what message a city sends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one. Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florence when I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turned out I was 450 years too late. Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won't know for sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hear it. When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first. It's an exciting place. So it took me quite a while to realize I just wasn't like the people there. I kept searching for the Cambridge of New York. It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptown by air. Some people know at 16 what sort of work they're going to do, but in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific to be ambitious about. They know they want to do something great. They just haven't decided yet whether they're going to be a rock star or a brain surgeon. There's nothing wrong with that. But it means if you have this most common type of ambition, you'll probably have to figure out where to live by trial and error. You'll probably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of ambition you have. **Notes** [1] This is one of the advantages of not having the universities in your country controlled by the government. When governments decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes things to be spread out geographically. No central goverment would put its two best universities in the same town, unless it was the capital (which would cause other problems). But scholars seem to like to cluster together as much as people in any other field, and when given the freedom to they derive the same advantages from it. [2] There are still a few old professors in Palo Alto, but one by one they die and their houses are transformed by developers into McMansions and sold to VPs of Bus Dev. [3] How many times have you read about startup founders who continued to live inexpensively as their companies took off? Who continued to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in grad school, and so on? If you did that in New York, people would treat you like shit. If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San Francisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to you; who knows who you might be? Not in New York. One sign of a city's potential as a technology center is the number of restaurants that still require jackets for men. According to Zagat's there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or Seattle, 4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and 20 in Paris. (Zagat's lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring jackets but I couldn't believe it, so I called to check and in fact they don't. Apparently there's only one restaurant left on the entire West Coast that still requires jackets: The French Laundry in Napa Valley.) [4] Ideas are one step upstream from economic power, so it's conceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge will one day have an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley has over New York. This seems unlikely at the moment; if anything Boston is falling further and further behind. The only reason I even mention the possibility is that the path from ideas to startups has recently been getting smoother. It's a lot easier now for a couple of hackers with no business experience to start a startup than it was 10 years ago. If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the balance of power will start to shift back. I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't bet against it either. [5] If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York the center of gravity of the art business? Because in the twentieth century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff. New York is where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand, and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, and David Sloo for reading drafts of this. **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). March 2005 _(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to me with questions. )_ Recently I've had several emails from computer science undergrads asking what to do in college. I might not be the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major in college. But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought I was one. I was certainly a hacker, at least. **Hacking** What should you do in college to become a [good hacker](gh.html)? There are two main things you can do: become very good at programming, and learn a lot about specific, cool problems. These turn out to be equivalent, because each drives you to do the other. The way to be good at programming is to work (a) a lot (b) on hard problems. And the way to make yourself work on hard problems is to work on some very engaging project. Odds are this project won't be a class assignment. My friend Robert learned a lot by writing network software when he was an undergrad. One of his projects was to connect Harvard to the Arpanet; it had been one of the original nodes, but by 1984 the connection had died. [1] Not only was this work not for a class, but because he spent all his time on it and neglected his studies, he was kicked out of school for a year. [2] It all evened out in the end, and now he's a professor at MIT. But you'll probably be happier if you don't go to that extreme; it caused him a lot of worry at the time. Another way to be good at programming is to find other people who are good at it, and learn what they know. Programmers tend to sort themselves into tribes according to the type of work they do and the tools they use, and some tribes are [smarter](pypar.html) than others. Look around you and see what the smart people seem to be working on; there's usually a reason. Some of the smartest people around you are professors. So one way to find interesting work is to volunteer as a research assistant. Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedious system-administration type problems for them, so that is a way to get a foot in the door. What they fear are flakes and resume padders. It's all too common for an assistant to result in a net increase in work. So you have to make it clear you'll mean a net decrease. Don't be put off if they say no. Rejection is almost always less personal than the rejectee imagines. Just move on to the next. (This applies to dating too.) Beware, because although most professors are smart, not all of them work on interesting stuff. Professors have to publish novel results to advance their careers, but there is more competition in more interesting areas of research. So what less ambitious professors do is turn out a series of papers whose conclusions are novel because no one else cares about them. You're better off avoiding these. I never worked as a research assistant, so I feel a bit dishonest recommending that route. I learned to program by writing stuff of my own, particularly by trying to reverse-engineer Winograd's SHRDLU. I was as obsessed with that program as a mother with a new baby. Whatever the disadvantages of working by yourself, the advantage is that the project is all your own. You never have to compromise or ask anyone's permission, and if you have a new idea you can just sit down and start implementing it. In your own projects you don't have to worry about novelty (as professors do) or profitability (as businesses do). All that matters is how hard the project is technically, and that has no correlation to the nature of the application. \"Serious\" applications like databases are often trivial and dull technically (if you ever suffer from insomnia, try reading the technical literature about databases) while \"frivolous\" applications like games are often very sophisticated. I'm sure there are game companies out there working on products with more intellectual content than the research at the bottom nine tenths of university CS departments. If I were in college now I'd probably work on graphics: a network game, for example, or a tool for 3D animation. When I was an undergrad there weren't enough cycles around to make graphics interesting, but it's hard to imagine anything more fun to work on now. **Math** When I was in college, a lot of the professors believed (or at least wished) that [computer science](hp.html) was a branch of math. This idea was strongest at Harvard, where there wasn't even a CS major till the 1980s; till then one had to major in applied math. But it was nearly as bad at Cornell. When I told the fearsome Professor Conway that I was interested in AI (a hot topic then), he told me I should major in math. I'm still not sure whether he thought AI required math, or whether he thought AI was nonsense and that majoring in something rigorous would cure me of such stupid ambitions. In fact, the amount of math you need as a hacker is a lot less than most university departments like to admit. I don't think you need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from the theory of computation. (You have to know what an n^2 algorithm is if you want to avoid writing them.) Unless you're planning to write math applications, of course. Robotics, for example, is all math. But while you don't literally need math for most kinds of hacking, in the sense of knowing 1001 tricks for differentiating formulas, math is very much worth studying for its own sake. It's a valuable source of metaphors for almost any kind of work. [3] I wish I'd studied more math in college for that reason. Like a lot of people, I was mathematically abused as a child. I learned to think of math as a collection of formulas that were neither beautiful nor had any relation to my life (despite attempts to translate them into \"word problems\"), but had to be memorized in order to do well on tests. One of the most valuable things you could do in college would be to learn what math is really about. This may not be easy, because a lot of good mathematicians are bad teachers. And while there are many popular books on math, few seem good. The best I can think of are W. W. Sawyer's. And of course Euclid. [4] **Everything** Thomas Huxley said \"Try to learn something about everything and everything about something.\" Most universities aim at this ideal. But what's everything? To me it means, all that people learn in the course of working honestly on hard problems. All such work tends to be related, in that ideas and techniques from one field can often be transplanted successfully to others. Even others that seem quite distant. For example, I write [essays](essay.html) the same way I write software: I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 as fast as I can type, then spend several weeks rewriting it. Working on hard problems is not, by itself, enough. Medieval alchemists were working on a hard problem, but their approach was so bogus that there was little to learn from studying it, except possibly about people's ability to delude themselves. Unfortunately the sort of AI I was trying to learn in college had the same flaw: a very hard problem, blithely approached with hopelessly inadequate techniques. Bold? Closer to fraudulent. The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they're so much influenced by intellectual [fashions](say.html). If a physicist met a colleague from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologist met a colleague from 100 years ago, they'd just get into an ideological argument. Yes, of course, you'll learn something by taking a psychology class. The point is, you'll learn more by taking a class in another department. The worthwhile departments, in my opinion, are math, the hard sciences, engineering, history (especially economic and social history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics. A survey course in art history may be worthwhile. Modern literature is important, but the way to learn about it is just to read. I don't know enough about music to say. You can skip the social sciences, philosophy, and the various departments created recently in response to political pressures. Many of these fields talk about important problems, certainly. But the way they talk about them is useless. For example, philosophy talks, among other things, about our obligations to one another; but you can learn more about this from a wise grandmother or E. B. White than from an academic philosopher. I speak here from experience. I should probably have been offended when people laughed at Clinton for saying \"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is.\" I took about five classes in college on what the meaning of \"is\" is. Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to create the _dropout graph._ For example, I know many people who switched from math to computer science because they found math too hard, and no one who did the opposite. People don't do hard things gratuitously; no one will work on a harder problem unless it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more rewarding. So probably math is more worth studying than computer science. By similar comparisons you can make a graph of all the departments in a university. At the bottom you'll find the subjects with least intellectual content. If you use this method, you'll get roughly the same answer I just gave. Language courses are an anomaly. I think they're better considered as extracurricular activities, like pottery classes. They'd be far more useful when combined with some time living in a country where the language is spoken. On a whim I studied Arabic as a freshman. It was a lot of work, and the only lasting benefits were a weird ability to identify semitic roots and some insights into how people recognize words. Studio art and creative writing courses are wildcards. Usually you don't get taught much: you just work (or don't work) on whatever you want, and then sit around offering \"crits\" of one another's creations under the vague supervision of the teacher. But writing and art are both very hard problems that (some) people work honestly at, so they're worth doing, especially if you can find a good teacher. **Jobs** Of course college students have to think about more than just learning. There are also two practical problems to consider: jobs, and graduate school. In theory a liberal education is not supposed to supply job training. But everyone knows this is a bit of a fib. Hackers at every college learn practical skills, and not by accident. What you should learn to get a job depends on the kind you want. If you want to work in a big company, learn how to hack [Blub](avg.html) on Windows. If you want to work at a cool little company or research lab, you'll do better to learn Ruby on Linux. And if you want to start your own company, which I think will be more and more common, master the most powerful tools you can find, because you're going to be in a race against your competitors, and they'll be your horse. There is not a direct correlation between the skills you should learn in college and those you'll use in a job. You should aim slightly high in college. In workouts a football player may bench press 300 pounds, even though he may never have to exert anything like that much force in the course of a game. Likewise, if your professors try to make you learn stuff that's more advanced than you'll need in a job, it may not just be because they're academics, detached from the real world. They may be trying to make you lift weights with your brain. The programs you write in classes differ in three critical ways from the ones you'll write in the real world: they're small; you get to start from scratch; and the problem is usually artificial and predetermined. In the real world, programs are bigger, tend to involve existing code, and often require you to figure out what the problem is before you can solve it. You don't have to wait to leave (or even enter) college to learn these skills. If you want to learn how to deal with existing code, for example, you can contribute to open-source projects. The sort of employer you want to work for will be as impressed by that as good grades on class assignments. In existing open-source projects you don't get much practice at the third skill, deciding what problems to solve. But there's nothing to stop you starting new projects of your own. And good employers will be even more impressed with that. What sort of problem should you try to solve? One way to answer that is to ask what you need as a user. For example, I stumbled on a good algorithm for spam filtering because I wanted to stop getting spam. Now what I wish I had was a mail reader that somehow prevented my inbox from filling up. I tend to use my inbox as a todo list. But that's like using a screwdriver to open bottles; what one really wants is a bottle opener. **Grad School** What about grad school? Should you go? And how do you get into a good one? In principle, grad school is professional training in research, and you shouldn't go unless you want to do research as a career. And yet half the people who get PhDs in CS don't go into research. I didn't go to grad school to become a professor. I went because I wanted to learn more. So if you're mainly interested in hacking and you go to grad school, you'll find a lot of other people who are similarly out of their element. And if half the people around you are out of their element in the same way you are, are you really out of your element? There's a fundamental problem in \"computer science,\" and it surfaces in situations like this. No one is sure what \"research\" is supposed to be. A lot of research is hacking that had to be crammed into the form of an academic paper to yield one more quantum of publication. So it's kind of misleading to ask whether you'll be at home in grad school, because very few people are quite at home in computer science. The whole field is uncomfortable in its own skin. So the fact that you're mainly interested in hacking shouldn't deter you from going to grad school. Just be warned you'll have to do a lot of stuff you don't like. Number one will be your dissertation. Almost everyone hates their dissertation by the time they're done with it. The process inherently tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake made out of whole wheat flour and baked for twelve hours. Few dissertations are read with pleasure, especially by their authors. But thousands before you have suffered through writing a dissertation. And aside from that, grad school is close to paradise. Many people remember it as the happiest time of their lives. And nearly all the rest, including me, remember it as a period that would have been, if they hadn't had to write a dissertation. [5] The danger with grad school is that you don't see the scary part upfront. PhD programs start out as college part 2, with several years of classes. So by the time you face the horror of writing a dissertation, you're already several years in. If you quit now, you'll be a grad-school dropout, and you probably won't like that idea. When Robert got kicked out of grad school for writing the Internet worm of 1988, I envied him enormously for finding a way out without the stigma of failure. On the whole, grad school is probably better than most alternatives. You meet a lot of smart people, and your glum procrastination will at least be a powerful common bond. And of course you have a PhD at the end. I forgot about that. I suppose that's worth something. The greatest advantage of a PhD (besides being the union card of academia, of course) may be that it gives you some baseline confidence. For example, the Honeywell thermostats in my house have the most atrocious UI. My mother, who has the same model, diligently spent a day reading the user's manual to learn how to operate hers. She assumed the problem was with her. But I can think to myself \"If someone with a PhD in computer science can't understand this thermostat, it _must_ be badly designed.\" If you still want to go to grad school after this equivocal recommendation, I can give you solid advice about how to get in. A lot of my friends are CS professors now, so I have the inside story about admissions. It's quite different from college. At most colleges, admissions officers decide who gets in. For PhD programs, the professors do. And they try to do it well, because the people they admit are going to be working for them. Apparently only recommendations really matter at the best schools. Standardized tests count for nothing, and grades for little. The essay is mostly an opportunity to disqualify yourself by saying something stupid. The only thing professors trust is recommendations, preferably from people they know. [6] So if you want to get into a PhD program, the key is to impress your professors. And from my friends who are professors I know what impresses them: not merely trying to impress them. They're not impressed by students who get good grades or want to be their research assistants so they can get into grad school. They're impressed by students who get good grades and want to be their research assistants because they're genuinely interested in the topic. So the best thing you can do in college, whether you want to get into grad school or just be good at hacking, is figure out what you truly like. It's hard to trick professors into letting you into grad school, and impossible to trick problems into letting you solve them. College is where faking stops working. From this point, unless you want to go work for a big company, which is like reverting to high school, the only way forward is through doing what you [love](love.html). **Notes** [1] No one seems to have minded, which shows how unimportant the Arpanet (which became the Internet) was as late as 1984. [2] This is why, when I became an employer, I didn't care about GPAs. In fact, we actively sought out people who'd failed out of school. We once put up posters around Harvard saying \"Did you just get kicked out for doing badly in your classes because you spent all your time working on some project of your own? Come work for us!\" We managed to find a kid who had been, and he was a great hacker. When Harvard kicks undergrads out for a year, they have to get jobs. The idea is to show them how awful the real world is, so they'll understand how lucky they are to be in college. This plan backfired with the guy who came to work for us, because he had more fun than he'd had in school, and made more that year from stock options than any of his professors did in salary. So instead of crawling back repentant at the end of the year, he took another year off and went to Europe. He did eventually graduate at about 26. [3] Eric Raymond says the best metaphors for hackers are in set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Trevor Blackwell reminds you to take math classes intended for math majors. \"'Math for engineers' classes sucked mightily. In fact any 'x for engineers' sucks, where x includes math, law, writing and visual design.\" [4] Other highly recommended books: _What is Mathematics?_ , by Courant and Robbins; _Geometry and the Imagination_ by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen. And for those interested in graphic design, [Byrne's Euclid](http://www.math.ubc.ca/people/faculty/cass/Euclid/byrne.html). [5] If you wanted to have the perfect life, the thing to do would be to go to grad school, secretly write your dissertation in the first year or two, and then just enjoy yourself for the next three years, dribbling out a chapter at a time. This prospect will make grad students' mouths water, but I know of no one who's had the discipline to pull it off. [6] One professor friend says that 15-20% of the grad students they admit each year are \"long shots.\" But what he means by long shots are people whose applications are perfect in every way, except that no one on the admissions committee knows the professors who wrote the recommendations. So if you want to get into grad school in the sciences, you need to go to college somewhere with real research professors. Otherwise you'll seem a risky bet to admissions committees, no matter how good you are. Which implies a surprising but apparently inevitable consequence: little liberal arts colleges are doomed. Most smart high school kids at least consider going into the sciences, even if they ultimately choose not to. Why go to a college that limits their options? **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Alex Lewin, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Eric Raymond, and several [anonymous CS professors](undergrad2.html) for reading drafts of this, and to the students whose questions began it. September 2007 A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college. For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up. What was I? A student. To do that well meant to get good grades. Why did one have to get good grades? To get into a good college. And why did one want to do that? There seemed to be several reasons: you'd learn more, get better jobs, make more money. But it didn't matter exactly what the benefits would be. College was a bottleneck through which all your future prospects passed; everything would be better if you went to a better college. A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I had stopped believing that. What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worrying obsessively about what [kindergarten](http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/education/features/15141/) your kids go to. It seemed to me this couldn't possibly matter. Either it won't help your kid get into Harvard, or if it does, getting into Harvard won't mean much anymore. And then I thought: how much does it mean even now? It turns out I have a lot of data about that. My three partners and I run a seed stage investment firm called [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com). We invest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea. The idea doesn't matter much; it will change anyway. Most of our decision is based on the founders. The average founder is three years out of college. Many have just graduated; a few are still in school. So we're in much the same position as a graduate program, or a company hiring people right out of college. Except our choices are immediately and visibly tested. There are two possible outcomes for a startup: success or failure—and usually you know within a year which it will be. The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real world tests. A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on the efforts of the founders. Success is decided by the market: you only succeed if users like what you've built. And users don't care where you went to college. As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of them. Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a traditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small ones. We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from about 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people. [1] Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocal test that's applied to our choices, Y Combinator has been an unprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners. One of the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters where people went to college. I thought I'd already been cured of caring about that. There's nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad. And yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd been to elite colleges. We'd interview people from MIT or Harvard or Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: they _must_ be smarter than they seem. It took us a few iterations to learn to trust our senses. Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard or Stanford must be smart. Even people who hate you for it believe it. But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite college, how could this be true? We're talking about a decision made by admissions officers—basically, HR people—based on a cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications submitted by seventeen year olds. And what do they have to go on? An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum; a high school record that's largely an index of obedience. Who would rely on such a test? And yet a lot of companies do. A lot of companies are very much influenced by where applicants went to college. How could they be? I think I know the answer to that. There used to be a saying in the corporate world: \"No one ever got fired for buying IBM.\" You no longer hear this about IBM specifically, but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of \"enterprise\" software companies that exist to take advantage of it. People buying technology for large organizations don't care if they pay a fortune for mediocre software. It's not their money. They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company with an established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and software that conforms to all the current fashions. Not necessarily a company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let you down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice. So companies have evolved to fill that niche. A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone buying technology for one. If someone went to Stanford and is not obviously insane, they're probably a safe bet. And a safe bet is enough. No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance of people they turn down. [2] I'm not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to prey upon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprise software companies have. But they work as if they had. In addition to the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges have two critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations work. They're good at doing what they're asked, since that's what it takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen. And having been to an elite college makes them more confident. Back in the days when people might spend their whole career at one big company, these qualities must have been very valuable. Graduates of elite colleges would have been capable, yet amenable to authority. And since individual performance is so hard to measure in large organizations, their own confidence would have been the starting point for their reputation. Things are very different in the new world of startups. We couldn't save someone from the market's judgement even if we wanted to. And being charming and confident counts for nothing with users. All users care about is whether you make something they like. If you don't, you're dead. Knowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the right answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people. We can't afford to have any illusions about the predictors of success. And what we've found is that the variation between schools is so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it's negligible by comparison. We can learn more about someone in the first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to school. It seems obvious when you put it that way. Look at the individual, not where they went to college. But that's a weaker statement than the idea I began with, that it doesn't matter much where a given individual goes to college. Don't you learn things at the best schools that you wouldn't learn at lesser places? Apparently not. Obviously you can't prove this in the case of a single individual, but you can tell from aggregate evidence: you can't, without asking them, distinguish people who went to one school from those who went to another three times as far down the _US News_ list. [3] Try it and see. How can this be? Because how much you learn in college depends a lot more on you than the college. A determined party animal can get through the best school without learning anything. And someone with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart people to learn from at a school that isn't prestigious at all. The other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite college; you learn more from them than the professors. But you should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make a conscious effort to find smart friends. At most colleges you can find at least a handful of other smart students, and most people have only a handful of close friends in college anyway. [4] The odds of finding smart professors are even better. The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students, especially in math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down the list of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in the math department. So it's not surprising that we've found the relative prestige of different colleges useless in judging individuals. There's a lot of randomness in how colleges select people, and what they learn there depends much more on them than the college. Between these two sources of variation, the college someone went to doesn't mean a lot. It is to some degree a predictor of ability, but so weak that we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously to ignore it. I doubt what we've discovered is an anomaly specific to startups. Probably people have always overestimated the importance of where one goes to college. We're just finally able to measure it. The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a superficial test, but that so many judge themselves by it. A lot of people, probably the majority of people in America, have some amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to college. The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest liability of not having gone to the college you'd have liked is your own feeling that you're thereby lacking something. Colleges are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect. There is only one real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know you wouldn't be missing much if you weren't. When you're excluded, you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider. But invariably they're larger in your imagination than in real life. So it is with colleges. Colleges differ, but they're nothing like the stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be. People aren't what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen. They're what they make themselves. Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to college is not just that you can stop judging them (and yourself) by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on what really matters. What matters is what you make of yourself. I think that's what we should tell kids. Their job isn't to get good grades so they can get into a good college, but to learn and do. And not just because that's more rewarding than worldly success. That will increasingly _be_ the route to worldly success. **Notes** [1] Is what we measure worth measuring? I think so. You can get rich simply by being energetic and unscrupulous, but getting rich from a technology startup takes some amount of brains. It is just the kind of work the upper middle class values; it has about the same intellectual component as being a doctor. [2] Actually, someone did, once. Mitch Kapor's wife Freada was in charge of HR at Lotus in the early years. (As he is at pains to point out, they did not become romantically involved till afterward.) At one point they worried Lotus was losing its startup edge and turning into a big company. So as an experiment she sent their recruiters the resumes of the first 40 employees, with identifying details changed. These were the people who had made Lotus into the star it was. Not one got an interview. [3] The _US News_ list? Surely no one trusts that. Even if the statistics they consider are useful, how do they decide on the relative weights? The reason the _US News_ list is meaningful is precisely because they are so intellectually dishonest in that respect. There is no external source they can use to calibrate the weighting of the statistics they use; if there were, we could just use that instead. What they must do is adjust the weights till the top schools are the usual suspects in about the right order. So in effect what the _US News_ list tells us is what the editors think the top schools are, which is probably not far from the conventional wisdom on the matter. The amusing thing is, because some schools work hard to game the system, the editors will have to keep tweaking their algorithm to get the rankings they want. [4] Possible doesn't mean easy, of course. A smart student at a party school will inevitably be something of an outcast, just as he or she would be in most [high schools](nerds.html). **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Peter Norvig, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. July 2020 One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded. I think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality than the beliefs prevalent in their society. [1] Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points. Anyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types, and the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that which quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules. The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded ones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules must be obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished. The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded, are the sheep. They're careful to obey the rules, but when other kids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will be punished, not to ensure that they will. The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded, are the dreamy ones. They don't care much about rules and probably aren't 100% sure what the rules even are. And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressively independent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule, their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to do makes them inclined to do the opposite. When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect to what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it's the rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules becomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school rules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite. In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive calls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call of the aggressively conventional-minded is \"Crush <outgroup>!\" (It's rather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but that's the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.) The call of the passively conventional- minded is \"What will the neighbors think?\" The call of the passively independent-minded is \"To each his own.\" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded is \"Eppur si muove.\" The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people than aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than independent- minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded are the largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the smallest. Since one's quadrant depends more on one's personality than the nature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadrant even if they'd grown up in a quite different society. Princeton professor Robert George recently wrote: > I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would have been had > they been white and living in the South before abolition. Guess what? They > all would have been abolitionists! They all would have bravely spoken out > against slavery, and worked tirelessly against it. He's too polite to say so, but of course they wouldn't. And indeed, our default assumption should not merely be that his students would, on average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, but that the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today would have been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words, that they'd not only not have fought against slavery, but that they'd have been among its staunchest defenders. I'm biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressively conventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customs we've evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protect the rest of us from them. In particular, the retirement of the concept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely debating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently considered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who try them out to see if they work. [2] Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because they have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be right. You have to be right when everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do that. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are not merely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it's no coincidence that societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs for keeping the conventional-minded at bay. [3] In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs protecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we're overreacting  that they haven't been weakened very much, or that they've been weakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I'll dispose of immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand, they always say it's in the service of a greater good. It just happens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time. As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being oversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn't been shut down that much, you can't judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded. You can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off unless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones at the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They're the canaries in this coalmine. The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don't want to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones. You'd think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a dangerous game they're playing. But I'll spell it out. There are two reasons why we need to be able to discuss even \"bad\" ideas. The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban is bound to make mistakes. All the more so because no one intelligent wants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being done by the stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you need to leave a margin for error. Which in this case means you need to ban fewer ideas than you'd like to. But that's hard for the aggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoy seeing people punished, as they have since they were children, and partly because they compete with one another. Enforcers of orthodoxy can't allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives other enforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department, and perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them. So instead of getting the margin for error we need, we get the opposite: a race to the bottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up being banned. [4] The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is that ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means if you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only affect those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that yields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edge case. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequences in fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world where some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that has a minefield in one corner. You don't just play the same game you would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a much more subdued game even on the ground that's safe. In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselves was to congregate in a handful of places  first in courts, and later in universities  where they could to some extent make their own rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customs protecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful air filters, or recording studios good sound insulation. For the last couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-minded were on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were the safest places to be. That may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate fact that the latest wave of intolerance began in universities. It began in the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died down, but it has recently flared up again with the arrival of social media. This seems, unfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley. Though the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded, they've handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool such as they could only have dreamed of. On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquiry within universities is as much the symptom of the departure of the independent-minded as the cause. People who would have become professors 50 years ago have other options now. Now they can become quants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded to succeed at either of those. If these people had been professors, they'd have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academic freedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeing declining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities are declining because so many have already left. [5] Though I've spent a lot of time thinking about this situation, I can't predict how it plays out. Could some universities reverse the current trend and remain places where the independent-minded want to congregate? Or will the independent-minded gradually abandon them? I worry a lot about what we might lose if that happened. But I'm hopeful long term. The independent-minded are good at protecting themselves. If existing institutions are compromised, they'll create new ones. That may require some imagination. But imagination is, after all, their specialty. **Notes** [1] I realize of course that if people's personalities vary in any two ways, you can use them as axes and call the resulting four quadrants personality types. So what I'm really claiming is that the axes are orthogonal and that there's significant variation in both. [2] The aggressively conventional-minded aren't responsible for all the trouble in the world. Another big source of trouble is the sort of charismatic leader who gains power by appealing to them. They become much more dangerous when such leaders emerge. [3] I never worried about writing things that offended the conventional-minded when I was running Y Combinator. If YC were a cookie company, I'd have faced a difficult moral choice. Conventional-minded people eat cookies too. But they don't start successful startups. So if I deterred them from applying to YC, the only effect was to save us work reading applications. [4] There has been progress in one area: the punishments for talking about banned ideas are less severe than in the past. There's little danger of being killed, at least in richer countries. The aggressively conventional-minded are mostly satisfied with getting people fired. [5] Many professors are independent-minded  especially in math, the hard sciences, and engineering, where you have to be to succeed. But students are more representative of the general population, and thus mostly conventional- minded. So when professors and students are in conflict, it's not just a conflict between generations but also between different types of people. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Nicholas Christakis, Patrick Collison, Sam Gichuru, Jessica Livingston, Patrick McKenzie, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this. **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). December 2010 Someone we funded is talking to VCs now, and asked me how common it was for a startup's founders to retain control of the board after a series A round. He said VCs told him this almost never happened. Ten years ago that was true. In the past, founders rarely kept control of the board through a series A. The traditional series A board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member. More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one independent. In either case the founders lose their majority. But not always. Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board through the series A and still has it today. Mark Pincus has kept control of Zynga's too. But are these just outliers? How common is it for founders to keep control after an A round? I'd heard of several cases among the companies we've funded, but I wasn't sure how many there were, so I emailed the ycfounders list. The replies surprised me. In a dozen companies we've funded, the founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series A round. I feel like we're at a tipping point here. A lot of VCs still act as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of. A lot of them try to make you feel bad if you even ask — as if you're a noob or a control freak for wanting such a thing. But the founders I heard from aren't noobs or control freaks. Or if they are, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and control freaks VCs should be trying to fund more of. Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of. And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it will become the norm. Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply outvoting other parties in board meetings. Investors usually get vetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless of how many board seats they have. And board votes are rarely split. Matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote, not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous. But if opinion is divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose in a vote will tend to be less insistent. That's what board control means in practice. You don't simply get to do whatever you want; the board still has to act in the interest of the shareholders; but if you have a majority of board seats, then your opinion about what's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail. So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary either. There's inevitably a difference in how things feel within the company. Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to retain board control after a series A, that will change the way things feel in the whole startup world. The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones. They're the ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs. A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups is that they're embarrassed to go back to their partners looking like they got beaten. When they sign a termsheet, they want to be able to brag about the good terms they got. A lot of them don't care that much personally about whether founders keep board control. They just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions. Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common. Like a lot of changes that have been forced on VCs, this change won't turn out to be as big a problem as they might think. VCs will still be able to convince; they just won't be able to compel. And the startups where they have to resort to compulsion are not the ones that matter anyway. VCs make most of their money from a few big hits, and those aren't them. Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help VCs pick better. If they know they can't fire the founders, they'll have to choose founders they can trust. And that's who they should have been choosing all along. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Brian Chesky, Bill Clerico, Patrick Collison, Adam Goldstein, James Lindenbaum, Jessica Livingston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this. March 2009 About twenty years ago people noticed computers and TV were on a collision course and started to speculate about what they'd produce when they converged. We now know the answer: computers. It's clear now that even by using the word \"convergence\" we were giving TV too much credit. This won't be convergence so much as replacement. People may still watch things they call \"TV shows,\" but they'll watch them mostly on computers. What decided the contest for computers? Four forces, three of which one could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to. One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open platform. Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market picks the winners. So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead of big company speeds. The second is Moore's Law, which has worked its usual magic on Internet bandwidth. [1] The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it not just because it's free, but because it's more convenient. Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer screen. [2] The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation: social applications. The average teenage kid has a pretty much infinite capacity for talking to their friends. But they can't physically be with them all the time. When I was in high school the solution was the telephone. Now it's social networks, multiplayer games, and various messaging applications. The way you reach them all is through a computer. [3] Which means every teenage kid (a) wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive to figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front of it. This was the most powerful force of all. This was what made everyone want computers. Nerds got computers because they liked them. Then gamers got them to play games on. But it was connecting to other people that got everyone else: that's what made even grandmas and 14 year old girls want computers. After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience, people in the entertainment business had understandably come to think of them as rather passive. They thought they'd be able to dictate the way shows reached audiences. But they underestimated the force of their desire to connect with one another. Facebook killed TV. That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but probably as close to the truth as you can get in three words. ___ The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are going, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online. But they're still dragging their heels. They still seem to wish people would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put their stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the next morning and read them printed on paper. They should both just face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium. They'd be in a better position if they'd done that earlier. When a new medium arises that's powerful enough to make incumbents nervous, then it's probably powerful enough to win, and the best thing they can do is jump in immediately. Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media: synchronicity and locality. On the Internet, you don't have to send everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to them from a local source. People will watch what they want when they want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared interest they feel most strongly. Maybe their strongest shared interest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not. Which means local TV is probably dead. It was an artifact of limitations imposed by old technology. If someone were creating an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top priority. Synchronicity and locality are tied together. TV network affiliates care what's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news at 11. This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however: people don't watch what's on at 10 because they want to watch the news afterward. TV networks will fight these trends, because they don't have sufficient flexibility to adapt to them. They're hemmed in by local affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by dealers and unions. Inevitably, the people running the networks will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for a couple more years, just as the record labels have done. A recent article in the _Wall Street Journal_ described how TV networks were trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewers watch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it suited them. Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks' obsolete business model. That never works unless you have a monopoly or cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily. The other reason networks like live shows is that they're cheaper to produce. There they have the right idea, but they haven't followed it to its conclusion. Live content can be way cheaper than networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramatic decreases in cost is to [increase volume](http://justin.tv). The networks are prevented from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think of themselves as being in the broadcast business—as sending one signal to everyone. [4] ___ [Now](badeconomy.html) would be a good time to start any company that competes with TV networks. That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though they may not have had this as an explicit goal. People only have so many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions (unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way quickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with it. But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV companies will increasingly face direct ones. Even in cable TV, the long tail was lopped off prematurely by the threshold you had to get over to start a new channel. It will be longer on the Internet, and there will be more mobility within it. In this new world, the existing players will only have the advantages any big company has in its market. That will change the balance of power between the networks and the people who produce shows. The networks used to be gatekeepers. They distributed your work, and sold advertising on it. Now the people who produce a show can distribute it themselves. The main value networks supply now is ad sales. Which will tend to put them in the position of service providers rather than publishers. Shows will change even more. On the Internet there's no reason to keep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single format. Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that's coming is between shows and games. But on the question of what sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years, I wouldn't dare to make any predictions, except that things will change a lot. We'll get whatever the most imaginative people can cook up. That's why the Internet won. **Notes** [1] Thanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point. He adds: \"I remember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when they talked about convergence. They thought most programming would be on demand, and they would implement it and make a lot of money. It didn't work out. They assumed that their local network infrastructure would be critical to do video on-demand, because you couldn't possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet. At the time (1992) the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth wasn't enough for one video stream. But wide-area bandwidth increased more than they expected and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu.\" [2] Copyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of piracy, which is the lost revenue. They therefore think what drives users to do it is the desire to get something for free. But iTunes shows that people will pay for stuff online, if you make it easy. A significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better user experience. [3] Or a phone that is actually a computer. I'm not making any predictions about the size of the device that will replace TV, just that it will have a browser and get data via the Internet. [4] Emmett Shear writes: \"I'd argue the long tail for sports may be even larger than the long tail for other kinds of content. Anyone can broadcast a high school football game that will be interesting to 10,000 people or so, even if the quality of production is not so good.\" **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Nancy Cook, Michael Seibel, Emmett Shear, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this. **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). August 2013 When people hurt themselves lifting heavy things, it's usually because they try to lift with their back. The right way to lift heavy things is to let your legs do the work. Inexperienced founders make the same mistake when trying to convince investors. They try to convince with their pitch. Most would be better off if they let their startup do the work — if they started by understanding why their startup is worth investing in, then simply explained this well to investors. Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful. But that test is not as simple as it sounds. In startups, as in a lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power law, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep. The big successes are so big they [dwarf](swan.html) the rest. And since there are only a handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat \"big success\" as if it were binary. Most are interested in you if you seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the 15 big successes, and otherwise not. [1] (There are a handful of angels who'd be interested in a company with a high probability of being moderately successful. But angel investors like big successes too.) How do you seem like you'll be one of the big successes? You need three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually) some evidence of success so far. **Formidable** The most important ingredient is formidable founders. Most investors decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change. [2] Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest. If investors think you're a winner they focus on the former, and if not they focus on the latter. For example, it might be a rich market, but with a slow sales cycle. If investors are impressed with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it's a rich market, and if not, they say they can't invest because of the slow sales cycle. They're not necessarily trying to mislead you. Most investors are genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike startups. If you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more. But don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you have it too; almost everyone does. There is a role for ideas of course. They're fuel for the fire that starts with liking the founders. Once investors like you, you'll see them reaching for ideas: they'll be saying \"yes, and you could also do x.\" (Whereas when they don't like you, they'll be saying \"but what about y?\") But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable, and since this isn't a word most people use in conversation much, I should explain what it means. A formidable person is one who seems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. Formidable is close to confident, except that someone could be confident and mistaken. Formidable is roughly justifiably confident. There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming formidable — some because they actually are very formidable and just let it show, and others because they are more or less con artists. [3] But most founders, including many who will go on to start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming formidable the first time they try fundraising. What should they do? [4] What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more experienced founders. Investors are not always that good at judging technology, but they're good at judging confidence. If you try to act like something you're not, you'll just end up in an uncanny valley. You'll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing. **Truth** The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth. How formidable you seem isn't a constant. It varies depending on what you're saying. Most people can seem confident when they're saying \"one plus one is two,\" because they know it's true. The most diffident person would be puzzled and even slightly contemptuous if they told a VC \"one plus one is two\" and the VC reacted with skepticism. The magic ability of people who are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this with the sentence \"we're going to make a billion dollars a year.\" But you can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly impressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first. That's the secret. Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll believe you. And by convince yourself, I don't mean play mind games with yourself to boost your confidence. I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn't, don't try to raise money. [5] But if it is, you'll be telling the truth when you tell investors it's worth investing in, and they'll sense that. You don't have to be a smooth presenter if you understand something well and tell the truth about it. To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert. If you're not a domain expert, you can be as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Which in fact it will usually be. And investors can tell fairly quickly whether you're a domain expert by how well you answer their questions. Know everything about your market. [6] Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things they're not convinced of themselves? Partly because we've all been trained to. When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in grad school, one of their fellow students was on the receiving end of a question from their faculty advisor that we still quote today. When the unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burst out: > Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe? One of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that we all get trained to talk even when we have nothing to say. If you have a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if you only have one page of ideas. Even if you have no ideas. You have to produce something. And all too many startups go into fundraising in the same spirit. When they think it's time to raise money, they try gamely to make the best case they can for their startup. Most never think of pausing beforehand to ask whether what they're saying is actually convincing, because they've all been trained to treat the need to present as a given — as an area of fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needs be spread, however thinly. The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach some artificial deadline like a Demo Day. It's when you can convince investors, and not before. [7] And unless you're a good con artist, you'll never convince investors if you're not convinced yourself. They're far better at detecting bullshit than you are at producing it, even if you're producing it unknowingly. If you try to convince investors before you've convinced yourself, you'll be wasting both your time. But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you from wasting your time. It will force you to organize your thoughts. To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you'll have to figure out why it's worth investing in. And if you can do that you'll end up with more than added confidence. You'll also have a provisional roadmap of how to succeed. **Market** Notice I've been careful to talk about whether a startup is worth investing in, rather than whether it's going to succeed. No one knows whether a startup is going to succeed. And it's a good thing for investors that this is so, because if you could know in advance whether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already be the future price, and there would be no room for investors to make money. Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and against pretty long odds. So to prove you're worth investing in, you don't have to prove you're going to succeed, just that you're a sufficiently good bet. What makes a startup a sufficiently good bet? In addition to formidable founders, you need a plausible path to owning a big piece of a big market. Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors think of them as markets. If there are x number of customers who'd pay an average of $y per year for what you're making, then the total addressable market, or TAM, of your company is $xy. Investors don't expect you to collect all that money, but it's an upper bound on how big you can get. Your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturable by you. But the market doesn't have to be big yet, nor do you necessarily have to be in it yet. Indeed, it's often better to start in a [small](ds.html) market that will either turn into a big one or from which you can move into a big one. There just has to be some plausible sequence of hops that leads to dominating a big market a few years down the line. The standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on the age of the startup. A three month old company at Demo Day only needs to be a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns out. Whereas a two year old company raising a series A round needs to be able to show the experiment worked. [8] But every company that gets really big is \"lucky\" in the sense that their growth is due mostly to some external wave they're riding, so to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have to identify some specific trend you'll benefit from. Usually you can find this by asking \"why now?\" If this is such a great idea, why hasn't someone else already done it? Ideally the answer is that it only recently became a good idea, because something changed, and no one else has noticed yet. Microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling Basic interpreters. But by starting there they were perfectly poised to expand up the stack of microcomputer software as microcomputers grew powerful enough to support one. And microcomputers turned out to be a really huge wave, bigger than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted in 1975. But while Microsoft did really well and there is thus a temptation to think they would have seemed a great bet a few months in, they probably didn't. Good, but not great. No company, however successful, ever looks more than a pretty good bet a few months in. Microcomputers turned out to be a big deal, and Microsoft both executed well and got lucky. But it was by no means obvious that this was how things would play out. Plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months in. I don't know about startups in general, but at least half the startups we fund could make as good a case as Microsoft could have for being on a path to dominating a large market. And who can reasonably expect more of a startup than that? **Rejection** If you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will you convince investors? Not always. A lot of VCs would have rejected Microsoft. [9] Certainly some rejected Google. And getting rejected will put you in a slightly awkward position, because as you'll see when you start fundraising, the most common question you'll get from investors will be \"who else is investing?\" What do you say if you've been fundraising for a while and no one has committed yet? [10] The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve this problem by giving investors the impression that while no investors have committed yet, several are about to. This is arguably a permissible tactic. It's slightly dickish of investors to care more about who else is investing than any other aspect of your startup, and misleading them about how far along you are with other investors seems the complementary countermove. It's arguably an instance of scamming a scammer. But I don't recommend this approach to most founders, because most founders wouldn't be able to carry it off. This is the single most common lie told to investors, and you have to be really good at lying to tell members of some profession the most common lie they're told. If you're not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are) the best solution is to tackle the problem head-on, and to explain why investors have turned you down and why they're mistaken. If you know you're on the right track, then you also know why investors were wrong to reject you. Experienced investors are well aware that the best ideas are also the scariest. They all know about the VCs who rejected Google. If instead of seeming evasive and ashamed about having been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing with the verdict) you talk candidly about what scared investors about you, you'll seem more confident, which they like, and you'll probably also do a better job of presenting that aspect of your startup. At the very least, that worry will now be out in the open instead of being a gotcha left to be discovered by the investors you're currently talking to, who will be proud of and thus attached to their discovery. [11] This strategy will work best with the best investors, who are both hard to bluff and who already believe most other investors are conventional-minded drones doomed always to miss the big outliers. Raising money is not like applying to college, where you can assume that if you can get into MIT, you can also get into Foobar State. Because the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and the best startup ideas look initially like [bad ideas](startupideas.html), it's not uncommon for a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones. That's what happened to Dropbox. Y Combinator started in Boston, and for the first 3 years we ran alternating batches in Boston and Silicon Valley. Because Boston investors were so few and so timid, we used to ship Boston batches out for a second Demo Day in Silicon Valley. Dropbox was part of a Boston batch, which means all those Boston investors got the first look at Dropbox, and none of them closed the deal. Yet another backup and syncing thing, they all thought. A couple weeks later, Dropbox raised a series A round from Sequoia. [12] **Different** Not understanding that investors view investments as bets combines with the ten page paper mentality to prevent founders from even considering the possibility of being certain of what they're saying. They think they're trying to convince investors of something very uncertain — that their startup will be huge — and convincing anyone of something like that must obviously entail some wild feat of salesmanship. But in fact when you raise money you're trying to convince investors of something so much less speculative — whether the company has all the elements of a good bet — that you can approach the problem in a qualitatively different way. You can convince yourself, then convince them. And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language you used to convince yourself. You wouldn't use vague, grandiose marketing-speak among yourselves. Don't use it with investors either. It not only doesn't work on them, but seems a mark of incompetence. Just be concise. Many investors explicitly use that as a test, reasoning (correctly) that if you can't explain your plans concisely, you don't really understand them. But even investors who don't have a rule about this will be bored and frustrated by unclear explanations. [13] So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already good at seeming formidable: 1. Make something worth investing in. 2. Understand why it's worth investing in. 3. Explain that clearly to investors. If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident when you're saying it. Conversely, never let pitching draw you into bullshitting. As long as you stay on the territory of truth, you're strong. Make the truth good, then just tell it. **Notes** [1] There's no reason to believe this number is a constant. In fact it's our explicit goal at Y Combinator to increase it, by encouraging people to start startups who otherwise wouldn't have. [2] Or more precisely, investors decide whether you're a loser or possibly a winner. If you seem like a winner, they may then, depending on how much you're raising, have several more meetings with you to test whether that initial impression holds up. But if you seem like a loser they're done, at least for the next year or so. And when they decide you're a loser they usually decide in way less than the 50 minutes they may have allotted for the first meeting. Which explains the astonished stories one always hears about VC inattentiveness. How could these people make investment decisions well when they're checking their messages during startups' presentations? The solution to that mystery is that they've already made the decision. [3] The two are not mutually exclusive. There are people who are both genuinely formidable, and also really good at acting that way. [4] How can people who will go on to create giant companies not seem formidable early on? I think the main reason is that their experience so far has trained them to keep their wings folded, as it were. Family, school, and jobs encourage cooperation, not conquest. And it's just as well they do, because even being Genghis Khan is probably 99% cooperation. But the result is that most people emerge from the tube of their upbringing in their early twenties compressed into the shape of the tube. Some find they have wings and start to spread them. But this takes a few years. In the beginning even they don't know yet what they're capable of. [5] In fact, change what you're doing. You're investing your own time in your startup. If you're not convinced that what you're working on is a sufficiently good bet, why are you even working on that? [6] When investors ask you a question you don't know the answer to, the best response is neither to bluff nor give up, but instead to explain how you'd figure out the answer. If you can work out a preliminary answer on the spot, so much the better, but explain that's what you're doing. [7] At YC we try to ensure startups are ready to raise money on Demo Day by encouraging them to ignore investors and instead focus on their companies till about a week before. That way most reach the stage where they're sufficiently convincing well before Demo Day. But not all do, so we also give any startup that wants to the option of deferring to a later Demo Day. [8] Founders are often surprised by how much harder it is to raise the next round. There is a qualitative difference in investors' attitudes. It's like the difference between being judged as a kid and as an adult. The next time you raise money, it's not enough to be promising. You have to be delivering results. So although it works well to show growth graphs at either stage, investors treat them differently. At three months, a growth graph is mostly evidence that the founders are effective. At two years, it has to be evidence of a promising market and a company tuned to exploit it. [9] By this I mean that if the present day equivalent of the 3 month old Microsoft presented at a Demo Day, there would be investors who turned them down. Microsoft itself didn't raise outside money, and indeed the venture business barely existed when they got started in 1975. [10] The best investors rarely care who else is investing, but mediocre investors almost all do. So you can use this question as a test of investor quality. [11] To use this technique, you'll have to find out why investors who rejected you did so, or at least what they claim was the reason. That may require asking, because investors don't always volunteer a lot of detail. Make it clear when you ask that you're not trying to dispute their decision — just that if there is some weakness in your plans, you need to know about it. You won't always get a real reason out of them, but you should at least try. [12] Dropbox wasn't rejected by all the East Coast VCs. There was one firm that wanted to invest but tried to lowball them. [13] Alfred Lin points out that it's doubly important for the explanation of a startup to be clear and concise, because it has to convince at one remove: it has to work not just on the partner you talk to, but when that partner re- tells it to colleagues. We consciously optimize for this at YC. When we work with founders create a Demo Day pitch, the last step is to imagine how an investor would sell it to colleagues. **Thanks** to Marc Andreessen, Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Ron Conway, Chris Dixon, Alfred Lin, Ben Horowitz, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Greg Mcadoo, Andrew Mason, Geoff Ralston, Yuri Sagalov, Emmett Shear, Rajat Suri, Garry Tan, Albert Wenger, Fred Wilson, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this. April 2020 I recently saw a [_video_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh4uS4f78o) of TV journalists and politicians confidently saying that the coronavirus would be no worse than the flu. What struck me about it was not just how mistaken they seemed, but how daring. How could they feel safe saying such things? The answer, I realized, is that they didn't think they could get caught. They didn't realize there was any danger in making false predictions. These people constantly make false predictions, and get away with it, because the things they make predictions about either have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way out of trouble, or happen so far in the future that few remember what they said. An epidemic is different. It falsifies your predictions rapidly and unequivocally. But epidemics are rare enough that these people clearly didn't realize this was even a possibility. Instead they just continued to use their ordinary m.o., which, as the epidemic has made clear, is to talk confidently about things they don't understand. An event like this is thus a uniquely powerful way of taking people's measure. As Warren Buffett said, \"It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked.\" And the tide has just gone out like never before. Now that we've seen the results, let's remember what we saw, because this is the most accurate test of credibility we're ever likely to have. I hope. December 2008 A few months ago I read a _New York Times_ article on South Korean cram schools that said > Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious young South > Korean. A parent added: > \"In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent of a > person's future.\" It was striking how old fashioned this sounded. And yet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off as a description of the US. Which means things must have been changing here. The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years ago. Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used to. What happened? _____ Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an advance. The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an exam on classical literature. [1] It was also a test of wealth, because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing required years of expensive training. But though wealth was a necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one. By the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system was very enlightened. Europeans didn't introduce formal civil service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem to have been influenced by the Chinese example. Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by family influence, if not outright bribery. It was a great step forward to judge people by their performance on a test. But by no means a perfect solution. When you judge people that way, you tend to get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth century England just as much as in present day South Korea. What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal. The use of credentials was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes in the seal. Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into credentials in the next. It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit whatever the tests measure. When the tests are narrow and predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores. But as the tests get broader, the schools do too. Preparing a candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years, as prep school does today. But the raison d'etre of all these institutions has been the same: to beat the system. [2] _____ History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from influencing their children's success directly. It's a fine thing for parents to help their children indirectly—for example, by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then makes them more successful. The problem comes when parents use direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power as a substitute for their children's qualities. Parents will tend to do this when they can. Parents will die for their kids, so it's not surprising to find they'll also push their scruples to the limits for them. Especially if other parents are doing it. Sealing off this force has a double advantage. Not only does a society get \"the best man for the job,\" but parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect ones—to actually trying to raise their kids well. But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents' efforts to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids. We're dealing with one of the most powerful forces in human nature. We shouldn't expect naive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions for keeping heroin out of a prison to work. _____ The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better. If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study the way people beat them and try to plug the holes. You can use the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are. They also tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram schools become less popular. A more general solution would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical social bottlenecks like college admissions. In the US this process still shows many outward signs of corruption. For example, legacy admissions. The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff. But what this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the bucket that straddles the cutoff. By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could probably make them more airtight. But what a long fight it would be. Especially when the institutions administering the tests don't really want them to be airtight. _____ Fortunately there's a better way to prevent the direct transmission of power between generations. Instead of trying to make credentials harder to hack, we can also make them matter less. Let's think about what credentials are for. What they are, functionally, is a way of predicting performance. If you could measure actual performance, you wouldn't need them. So why did they even evolve? Why haven't we just been measuring actual performance? Think about where credentialism first appeared: in selecting candidates for large organizations. Individual performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the harder performance is to measure, the more important it is to predict it. If an organization could immediately and cheaply measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine their credentials. They could take everyone and keep just the good ones. Large organizations can't do this. But a bunch of small organizations in a market can come close. A market takes every organization and keeps just the good ones. As organizations get smaller, this approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones. So all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller organizations will care less about credentials. _____ That's what's been happening in the US. That's why those quotes from Korea sound so old fashioned. They're talking about an economy like America's a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies. The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join one and climb to the top. Credentials matter a lot then. In the culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This doesn't work in small companies. Even if your colleagues were impressed by your credentials, they'd soon be parted from you if your performance didn't match, because the company would go out of business and the people would be dispersed. In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares about. People hiring for a startup don't care whether you've even graduated from college, let alone which one. All they care about is what you can do. Which is in fact all that should matter, even in a large organization. The reason credentials have such prestige is that for so long the large organizations in a society tended to be the most powerful. But in the US at least they don't have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely because they can't measure (and thus reward) individual performance. Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can get rewarded directly by the market? I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most other people. As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm, I'm like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of credentials and into the new one of performance. I'm an agent of the change I'm seeing. But I don't think I'm imagining it. It was not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be judged directly by the market. You had to go through bosses, and they were influenced by where you'd been to college. _____ What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America? I'm still not entirely sure. Startups are certainly a large part of it. Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large ones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable. But I don't think startups account for all the shift from credentials to measurement. My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates far less than firms do today. Law firms then made no pretense of paying people according to the value of the work they'd done. Pay was based on seniority. The younger employees were paying their dues. They'd be rewarded later. The same principle prevailed at industrial companies. When my father was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had people working for him who made more than he did, because they'd been there longer. Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for the work they do. One reason is that employees no longer trust companies to deliver [deferred rewards](ladder.html): why work to accumulate deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out? The other is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees large amounts. This was particularly true in consulting, law, and finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies. The word is rarely used today because it's no longer surprising to see a 25 year old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old _professional_ able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it called forth a new word. The classic yuppie worked for a small organization. He didn't work for General Widget, but for the law firm that handled General Widget's acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their bond issues. Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I don't think there was a causal connection. Startups happened because technology started to change so fast that big companies could no longer keep a lid on the smaller ones. I don't think the rise of yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way big companies worked. But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce a principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people market rates, and getting correspondingly high performance from them. At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums that had afflicted it for most of the 1970s. Was there a connection? I don't know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time. There was a lot of energy released. _____ Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be concerned about the number of startups started within them. But they would do even better to examine the underlying principle. Do they let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work they do? The young are the test, because when people aren't rewarded according to performance, they're invariably rewarded according to seniority instead. All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for performance. Measurement spreads like heat. If one part of a society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the others to do better. If people who are young but smart and driven can make more by starting their own companies than by working for existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to keep them. So market rates gradually permeate every organization, even the government. [3] The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations issuing credentials into line. When we were kids I used to annoy my sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do anyway. As credentials are superseded by performance, a similar role is the best former gatekeepers can hope for. Once credential granting institutions are no longer in the self- fullfilling prophecy business, they'll have to work harder to predict the future. _____ Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence. But they're not the final step. There's an even better way to block the transmission of power between generations: to encourage the trend toward an economy made of more, smaller units. Then you can measure what credentials merely predict. No one likes the transmission of power between generations—not the left or the right. But the market forces favored by the right turn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials the left are forced to fall back on. The era of credentials began to end when the power of large organizations [peaked](highres.html) in the late twentieth century. Now we seem to be entering a new era based on measurement. The reason the new model has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better. It shows no sign of slowing. **Notes** [1] Miyazaki, Ichisada (Conrad Schirokauer trans. ), _China's Examination Hell: The Civil Service Examinations of Imperial China,_ Yale University Press, 1981.

[2] When I say the raison d'etre of prep schools is to get kids into better colleges, I mean this in the narrowest sense. I'm not saying that's all prep schools do, just that if they had zero effect on college admissions there would be far less demand for them.

September 2009 Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to predict which startups will succeed. We probably spend more time thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest. Prediction is usually all we have to rely on. We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is determination. At first we thought it might be intelligence. Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed. It makes a better story that a company won because its founders were so smart. The PR people and reporters who spread such stories probably believe them themselves. But while it certainly helps to be smart, it's not the deciding factor. There are plenty of people as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing. In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination starts to look like talent. I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but the relative importance of determination and talent probably do vary somewhat. Talent probably matters more in types of work that are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type of problem instead of many different types. I suspect determination would not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized crime. I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that depend more on talent are always more admirable. Most people would agree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural ability. Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being smarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups than it used to in earlier types of companies. You probably do need to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had to be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers. And that's probably an ongoing trend. But even in the highest of high tech industries, success still depends more on determination than brains. If determination is so important, can we isolate its components? Are some more important than others? Are there some you can cultivate? The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness. When you want something, you must have it, no matter what. A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common to see families where one sibling has much more of it than another. Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, nature seems to be more important than nurture. Bad circumstances can break the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don't think there's much you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger- willed. Being strong-willed is not enough, however. You also have to be hard on yourself. Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent would not be called determined. Determination implies your willfulness is balanced by discipline. That word balance is a significant one. The more willful you are, the more disciplined you have to be. The stronger your will, the less anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself. And someone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses, and if you have more will than discipline you'll just give into them and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction. We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a slippery melon seed. The harder they squeeze, the further the seed flies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins off sideways. If this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline can be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in the course of an individual's life. If determination is effectively the product of will and discipline, then you can become more determined by being more disciplined. [1] Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful you are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined. There seem to be plenty of examples to confirm that. In some very energetic people's lives you see something like wing flutter, where they alternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing. Externally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder. The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however: it's static. In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase with temptation. Which means, interestingly, that determination tends to erode itself. If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great things, this will probably increase the number of temptations around you. Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulness will then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to the mean. That's why Shakespeare's Caesar thought thin men so dangerous. They weren't tempted by the minor perquisites of power. The melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined. Is it? I think there probably are people whose willfulness is crushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more if they weren't so hard on themselves. One reason the young sometimes succeed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetent they are. This lets them do a kind of deficit spending. When they first start working on something, they overrate their achievements. But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance improves. Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from continuing. There's one other major component of determination: ambition. If willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination, ambition is how you choose it. I don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a component of determination, but they're not entirely orthogonal. It would seem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to do something trivially easy. And fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there's a lot you can do to increase it. Most people don't know how ambitious to be, especially when they're young. They don't know what's hard, or what they're capable of. And this problem is exacerbated by having few peers. Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone is mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives, then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers. When you take people like this and put them together with other ambitious people, they bloom like dying plants given water. Probably most ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd get from ambitious peers, whatever their age. [2] Achievements also tend to increase your ambition. With each step you gain confidence to stretch further next time. So here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists of willfulness balanced with discipline, aimed by ambition. And fortunately at least two of these three qualities can be cultivated. You may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you can definitely learn self-discipline; and almost everyone is practically malnourished when it comes to ambition. I feel like I understand determination a bit better now. But only a bit: willfulness, discipline, and ambition are all concepts almost as complicated as determination. [3] Note too that determination and talent are not the whole story. There's a third factor in achievement: how much you like the work. If you really [love](love.html) working on something, you don't need determination to drive you; it's what you'd do anyway. But most types of work have aspects one doesn't like, because most types of work consist of doing things for other people, and it's very unlikely that the tasks imposed by their needs will happen to align exactly with what you want to do. Indeed, if you want to create the most [wealth](wealth.html), the way to do it is to focus more on their needs than your interests, and make up the difference with determination. **Notes** [1] Loosely speaking. What I'm claiming with the melon seed model is more like determination is proportionate to wd^m - k|w - d|^n, where w is will and d discipline. [2] Which means one of the best ways to help a society generally is to create [events](http://startupschool.org) and [institutions](http://ycombinator.com) that bring ambitious people together. It's like pulling the control rods out of a reactor: the energy they emit encourages other ambitious people, instead of being absorbed by the normal people they're usually surrounded with. Conversely, it's probably a mistake to do as some European countries have done and try to ensure none of your universities is significantly better than the others. [3] For example, willfulness clearly has two subcomponents, stubbornness and energy. The first alone yields someone who's stubbornly inert. The second alone yields someone flighty. As willful people get older or otherwise lose their energy, they tend to become merely stubborn. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). August 2007 _(This is a talk I gave at the last Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually we don't have a speaker at the last dinner; it's more of a party. But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could save some of the startups from preventable deaths. So at the last minute I cooked up this rather grim talk. I didn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while writing. )_ A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third of the companies we funded to succeed. Actually I was being conservative. I'm hoping it might be as much as a half. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate? Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die. Phrased that way, it doesn't sound good at all. In fact, it's kind of weird when you think about it, because our definition of success is that the founders get rich. If half the startups we fund succeed, then half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to get nothing. If you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke, but it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich. It was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive. So even in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper. You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity meeting preparation. You've now done the preparation. The work you've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die. That's more than most people have. So let's talk about how not to die. We've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups die. About 10 of them so far. We don't know exactly what happens when they die, because they generally don't die loudly and heroically. Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die. For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear from you. When we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a couple months, that's a bad sign. If we send them an email asking what's up, and they don't reply, that's a really bad sign. So far that is a 100% accurate predictor of death. Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they're probably going to live. I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won't die. That may not be so naive as it sounds. You've probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day. Every dinner is a kind of a deadline. So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time we talked. If this works, it would be an amazing hack. It would be pretty cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get rich. It sounds crazy, but there's a good chance that would work. A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups. There is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco. If you move there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will continue to operate. When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that they've become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup that's working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they can't pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server. Startups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing! If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup can be demoralizing. That is certainly true. I've been there, and that's why I've never done another startup. The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low. I bet even Google had moments where things seemed hopeless. Knowing that should help. If you know it's going to feel terrible sometimes, then when it feels terrible you won't think \"ouch, this feels terrible, I give up.\" It feels that way for everyone. And if you just hang on, things will probably get better. The metaphor people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller coaster and not drowning. You don't just sink and sink; there are ups after the downs. Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a startup is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working. The reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably won't work. Startups almost never get it right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. Don't assume when this happens that you've failed. That's normal for startups. But don't sit around doing nothing. Iterate. I like Paul Buchheit's suggestion of trying to make something that at least someone really loves. As long as you've made something that a few users are ecstatic about, you're on the right track. It will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who really love you, and startups run on morale. But also it will tell you what to focus on. What is it about you that they love? Can you do more of that? Where can you find more people who love that sort of thing? As long as you have some core of users who love you, all you have to do is expand it. It may take a while, but as long as you keep plugging away, you'll win in the end. Both Blogger and Delicious did that. Both took years to succeed. But both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally. [Wufoo](http://wufoo.com) is on the same trajectory now. So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look more closely. Are there zero users who really love you, or is there at least some little group that does? It's quite possible there will be zero. In that case, tweak your product and try again. Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one winning permutation somewhere in it. If you just keep trying, you'll find it. Let me mention some things not to do. The number one thing not to do is other things. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with \"but we're going to keep working on the startup,\" you are in big trouble. Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're moving back to Minnesota, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're taking on some consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup. You may as well just translate these to \"we're giving up on the startup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves,\" because that's what it means most of the time. A startup is so hard that working on it can't be preceded by \"but.\" In particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other projects. Distraction is fatal to startups. Going to (or back to) school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the distraction it gives you something to say you're doing. If you're only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail. If you're in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later \"Oh yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school, but it didn't go anywhere.\" You can't use euphemisms like \"didn't go anywhere\" for something that's your only occupation. People won't let you. One of the most interesting things we've discovered from working on Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of looking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars. So if you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a position where failure will be public and humiliating. When we first met the founders of [Octopart](http://octopart.com), they seemed very smart, but not a great bet to succeed, because they didn't seem especially committed. One of the two founders was still in grad school. It was the usual story: he'd drop out if it looked like the startup was taking off. Since then he has not only dropped out of grad school, but appeared full length in [Newsweek](http://docs.octopart.com/newsweek_octopart_small.jpg) with the word \"Billionaire\" printed across his chest. He just cannot fail now. Everyone he knows has seen that picture. Girls who dissed him in high school have seen it. His mom probably has it on the fridge. It would be unthinkably humiliating to fail now. At this point he is committed to fight to the death. I wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article describing them as the next generation of billionaires, because then none of them would be able to give up. The success rate would be 90%. I'm not kidding. When we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery guys. Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined. The electronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keep their monopoly pricing. (If it strikes you as odd that people still order electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there's a reason for that. The distributors want to prevent the transparency that comes from having prices online.) I feel kind of bad that we've transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined. But that comes with the territory. If a startup succeeds, you get millions of dollars, and you don't get that kind of money just by asking for it. You have to assume it takes some amount of pain. And however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they'll succeed. They may have to morph themselves into something totally different, but they won't just crawl off and die. They're smart; they're working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up. All of you guys already have the first two. You're all smart and working on promising ideas. Whether you end up among the living or the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up. So I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming. It always is in a startup. The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of disaster happening are one in a thousand. So don't get demoralized. When the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was what Paul was talking about. What did he say to do? Oh, yeah. Don't give up. March 2008 The web is turning writing into a conversation. Twenty years ago, writers wrote and readers read. The web lets readers respond, and increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their own blog posts. Many who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there's less to say. You could expand on something the author said, but he has probably already explored the most interesting implications. When you disagree you're entering territory he may not have explored. The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially measured by the word. That doesn't mean people are getting angrier. The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account for it. But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier. Particularly online, where it's easy to say things you'd never say face to face. If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to do it well. What does it mean to disagree well? Most readers can tell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the intermediate stages. So here's an attempt at a disagreement hierarchy: **DH0. Name-calling. ** This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most common. We've all seen comments like this: > u r a fag!!!!!!!!!! But it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has just as little weight. A comment like > The author is a self-important dilettante. is really nothing more than a pretentious version of \"u r a fag.\" **DH1. Ad Hominem. ** An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling. It might actually carry some weight. For example, if a senator wrote an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could respond: > Of course he would say that. He's a senator. This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be relevant to the case. It's still a very weak form of disagreement, though. If there's something wrong with the senator's argument, you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does it make that he's a senator? Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic is a variant of ad hominem—and a particularly useless sort, because good ideas often come from outsiders. The question is whether the author is correct or not. If his lack of authority caused him to make mistakes, point those out. And if it didn't, it's not a problem. **DH2. Responding to Tone. ** The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather than the writer. The lowest form of these is to disagree with the author's tone. E.g. > I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier > fashion. Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form of disagreement. It matters much more whether the author is wrong or right than what his tone is. Especially since tone is so hard to judge. Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral. So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize its tone, you're not saying much. Is the author flippant, but correct? Better that than grave and wrong. And if the author is incorrect somewhere, say where. **DH3. Contradiction. ** In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom. The lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting evidence. This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in: > I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier > fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory. Contradiction can sometimes have some weight. Sometimes merely seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that it's right. But usually evidence will help. **DH4. Counterargument. ** At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement: counterargument. Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as proving nothing. Counterargument might prove something. The problem is, it's hard to say exactly what. Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence. When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing. But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at something slightly different. More often than not, two people arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two different things. Sometimes they even agree with one another, but are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it. There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different from what the original author said: when you feel they missed the heart of the matter. But when you do that, you should say explicitly you're doing it. **DH5. Refutation. ** The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation. It's also the rarest, because it's the most work. Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you go the fewer instances you find. To refute someone you probably have to quote them. You have to find a \"smoking gun,\" a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken. If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man. While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily imply refutation. Some writers quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0. **DH6. Refuting the Central Point. ** The force of a refutation depends on what you refute. The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point. Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty, as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes those. Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation. For example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes in names or numbers. Unless the opposing argument actually depends on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to discredit one's opponent. Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of them. And that means one has to commit explicitly to what the central point is. So a truly effective refutation would look like: > The author's main point seems to be x. As he says: > >> <quotation> > > But this is wrong for the following reasons... The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual statement of the author's main point. It's enough to refute something it depends upon. **What It Means** Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement. What good is it? One thing the disagreement hierarchy _doesn't_ give us is a way of picking a winner. DH levels merely describe the form of a statement, not whether it's correct. A DH6 response could still be completely mistaken. But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness of a reply, they do set an upper bound. A DH6 response might be unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing. The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement is that it will help people to evaluate what they read. In particular, it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments. An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing an opponent merely by using forceful words. In fact that is probably the defining quality of a demagogue. By giving names to the different forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping such balloons. Such labels may help writers too. Most intellectual dishonesty is unintentional. Someone arguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he's really saying something. Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation. But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but that it will make the people who have them happier. If you study conversations, you find there is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6. You don't have to be mean when you have a real point to make. In fact, you don't want to. If you have something real to say, being mean just gets in the way. If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean, that will make most of them happier. Most people don't really enjoy being mean; they do it because they can't help it. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this. **Related:** January 2017 Because biographies of famous scientists tend to edit out their mistakes, we underestimate the degree of risk they were willing to take. And because anything a famous scientist did that wasn't a mistake has probably now become the conventional wisdom, those choices don't seem risky either. Biographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus more on physics than alchemy or theology. The impression we get is that his unerring judgment led him straight to truths no one else had noticed. How to explain all the time he spent on alchemy and theology? Well, smart people are often kind of crazy. But maybe there is a simpler explanation. Maybe the smartness and the craziness were not as separate as we think. Physics seems to us a promising thing to work on, and alchemy and theology obvious wastes of time. But that's because we know how things turned out. In Newton's day the three problems seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet what the payoff would be for inventing what we now call physics; if they had, more people would have been working on it. And alchemy and theology were still then in the category Marc Andreessen would describe as \"huge, if true.\" Newton made three bets. One of them worked. But they were all risky. September 2009 When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is to seem extra friendly. You smile and say \"pleased to meet you,\" whether you are or not. There's nothing dishonest about this. Everyone knows that these little social lies aren't meant to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that \"Can you pass the salt?\" is only grammatically a question. I'm perfectly willing to smile and say \"pleased to meet you\" when meeting new people. But there is another set of customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so harmless. The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print is that most essays are written to persuade. And as any politician could tell you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the facts. You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down. For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of a government program will not merely say \"The program is canceled.\" That would seem offensively curt. Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the noble effort made by the people who worked on it. The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they interact with the ideas. Saying \"pleased to meet you\" is just something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin added by politicians is woven through it. We're starting to move from social lies to real lies. Here's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about [labor unions](unions.html). As written, it tends to offend people who like unions. > People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union > organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now? The best > they can do is fall back on the default explanation of people living in > fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were giants. The workers of the early > twentieth century must have had a moral courage that's lacking today. Now here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of offending them: > Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions for > workers. But though labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present > union leaders are any less courageous. An employer couldn't get away with > hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they did, I see no > reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink from the challenge. So > I think it would be a mistake to attribute the decline of unions to some > kind of decline in the people who run them. Early union leaders were heroic, > certainly, but we should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's > because present union leaders are somehow inferior. The cause must be > external. [1] It makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful, but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day union leaders would have to be inferior people. But written this way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather than an attack on early ones. That makes it more persuasive to people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause. I believe everything I wrote in the second version. Early union leaders did make heroic sacrifices. And present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if necessary. People tend to; I'm skeptical about the idea of \"the greatest generation.\" [2] If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn't I write it that way? Why offend people needlessly? Because I'd rather offend people than pander to them, and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other. The degree of courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all that matters for the argument is that they're the same. But if you want to please people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth. You're always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their misconceptions from bumping against reality. Most writers do. Most writers write to persuade, if only out of habit or politeness. But I don't write to persuade; I write to figure out. I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased reader. Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone who doesn't will seem arrogant. In fact, worse than arrogant: since readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander to the other. To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host would say to stir up his followers. But it's not. Something that curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same place they come from different sources. Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feel better? Maybe not. Maybe I'm excessively attached to conciseness. I write [code](power.html) the same way I write essays, making pass after pass looking for anything I can cut. But I have a legitimate reason for doing this. You don't know what the ideas are until you get them down to the fewest words. [3] The danger of the second paragraph is not merely that it's longer. It's that you start to lie to yourself. The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions. I think the goal of an essay should be to discover [surprising](essay.html) things. That's my goal, at least. And most surprising means most different from what people currently believe. So writing to persuade and writing to discover are diametrically opposed. The more your conclusions disagree with readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on selling your ideas rather than having them. As you accelerate, this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100% of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any faster. It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's. I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously from ideas I knew would be hard to sell. When I notice something surprising, it's usually very faint at first. There's nothing more than a slight stirring of discomfort. I don't want anything to get in the way of noticing it consciously. **Notes** [1] I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing this. To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious crap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction. The solution was a kind of method acting. It was revoltingly familiar to slip back into it. [2] Exercise for the reader: rephrase that thought to please the same people the first version would offend. [3] Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately pander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words: I switch person. This flattering distinction seems so natural to the average reader that they probably don't notice even when I switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done as conspicuously as this. **Thanks** to Jessica Livingston and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. **Note:** An earlier version of this essay began by talking about why people dislike Michael Arrington. I now believe that was mistaken, and that most people don't dislike him for the same reason I did when I first met him, but simply because he writes about controversial things. _Note: The strategy described at the end of this essay didn't work. It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself using the Internet on my work computer. I'm trying other strategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure they work before writing about them._ May 2008 Procrastination feeds on distractions. Most people find it uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing something else. So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions. But that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are people working hard to distract you. Distraction is not a static obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road. Distraction seeks you out. Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place. Distracting is, similarly, desirable at the wrong time. And technology is continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things. Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions, new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria. Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached the point where it's like visual crack. I realized when I was 13 that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it. But I read recently that the average American watches [4 hours](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0929/076.html) of TV a day. A quarter of their life. TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more addictive ways of wasting time. And what's especially dangerous is that many happen at your computer. This is no accident. An ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers connected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward the procrastinators. I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for work. I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp files, but most of the time I was offline. All I could do was write and program. Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my desk. Terribly addictive things are just a click away. Run into an obstacle in what you're working on? Hmm, I wonder what's new online. Better check. After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games, and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because I didn't realize that it evolves. Something that used to be safe, using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous. Some days I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real work done. And this started to happen more and more often. It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet had become, because the problem was intermittent. I ignored it the way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently. When I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a problem. It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding what to do next that they always bit me. Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type of distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with it. If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV, I'd have noticed very quickly. That's a known danger sign, like drinking alone. But using the Internet still looked and felt a lot like work. Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much more distracting that I had to start treating it differently. Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time sinks: Firefox. * * * The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need the Internet for some things. If you drink too much, you can solve that problem by stopping entirely. But you can't solve the problem of overeating by stopping eating. I couldn't simply avoid the Internet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks. At first I tried rules. For example, I'd tell myself I was only going to use the Internet twice a day. But these schemes never worked for long. Eventually something would come up that required me to use it more than that. And then I'd gradually slip back into my old ways. Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient adversaries—as if there were a little man in your head always cooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you're trying to stop doing. If you leave a path to it, he'll find it. The key seems to be visibility. The biggest ingredient in most bad habits is denial. So you have to make it so that you can't merely _slip_ into doing the thing you're trying to avoid. It has to set off alarms. Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet distractions will be [software](http://rescuetime.com) that watches and controls them. But in the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitely works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet. I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need to transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop on the other side of the room that I use to check mail or browse the web. (Irony of ironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on. When Steve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I bought them for the Y Combinator museum.) My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long as I do it on that computer. And this turns out to be enough. When I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse the web, I become much more aware of it. Sufficiently aware, in my case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an hour a day online. And my main computer is now freed for work. If you try this trick, you'll probably be struck by how different it feels when your computer is disconnected from the Internet. It was alarming to me how foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that could only be used for work, because that showed how much time I must have been wasting. _Wow. All I can do at this computer is work. Ok, I better work then._ That's the good part. Your old bad habits now help you to work. You're used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at a time. But you can't browse the web or check email now. What are you going to do? You can't just sit there. So you start working. December 2008 _(I originally wrote this at the request of a company producing a report about entrepreneurship. Unfortunately after reading it they decided it was too controversial to include. )_ VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession, like it usually does in bad times. But this time the result may be different. This time the number of new startups may not decrease. And that could be dangerous for VCs. When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried up too. There were not a lot of new startups being founded in 2003\\. But startups aren't tied to VC the way they were 10 years ago. It's now possible for VCs and startups to diverge. And if they do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better. The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much cheaper to start a startup. There are four main reasons: Moore's law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free; the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful programming languages mean development teams can be smaller. These changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the noise. In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded by Y Combinator—the biggest expense is simply the founders' living expenses. We've had startups that were profitable on revenues of $3000 a month. $3000 is insignificant as revenues go. Why should anyone care about a startup making $3000 a month? Because, although insignificant as _revenue_ , this amount of money can change a startup's _funding_ situation completely. Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their mind how much \"runway\" they have—how long they have till the money in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable, raise more money, or go out of business. Once you cross the threshold of profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite. It's a qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines and disappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed. Once you're profitable you don't need investors' money. And because Internet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold of profitability can be trivially low. Which means many Internet startups don't need VC-scale investments anymore. For many startups, VC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to a nice-to-have. This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have been largely masked so far. It was during the trough after the Internet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup, but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion. When startups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were starting to write checks again. And while founders may not have needed VC money the way they used to, they were willing to take it if offered—partly because there was a tradition of startups taking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend to eat when given the opportunity. As long as VCs were writing checks, founders were never forced to explore the limits of how little they needed them. There were a few startups who hit these limits accidentally because of their unusual circumstances—most famously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into startup land from the other direction: they started as a consulting firm, so they had revenue before they had a product. VCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted together. Around 2000 the bolt was removed. Because the components have so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem to be joined together, but really one is just resting on the other. A sharp impact would make them fly apart. And the present recession could be that impact. Because of Y Combinator's position at the extreme end of the spectrum, we'd be the first to see signs of a separation between founders and investors, and we are in fact seeing it. For example, though the stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious, it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who want to start startups. We take applications for funding every 6 months. Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October 17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a record number, up 40% from the same cycle a year before. Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economy continues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening of interest among potential founders. That's different from the way things felt in 2001. Then there was a widespread feeling among potential founders that startups were over, and that one should just go to grad school. That isn't happening this time, and part of the reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to build something that makes $3000 a month. If investors stop writing checks, who cares? We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investors in the attitudes of existing startups we've funded. I was talking to one recently that had a round fall through at the last minute over the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel they have the upper hand—over an uncertainty about whether the founders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believe that. And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: their traffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off. So I asked them if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors. To my surprise, they said no—that they'd just spent four months dealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier now that they didn't have to. There was a friend they wanted to hire with the investor money, and now they'd have to postpone that. But otherwise they felt they had enough in the bank to make it to profitability. To make sure, they were moving to a cheaper apartment. And in this economy I bet they got a good deal on it. I've detected this \"investors aren't worth the trouble\" vibe from several YC founders I've talked to recently. At least one startup from the most recent (summer) cycle may not even raise angel money, let alone VC. [Ticketstumbler](http://ticketstumbler.com) made it to profitability on Y Combinator's $15,000 investment and they hope not to need more. This surprised even us. Although YC is based on the idea of it being cheap to start a startup, we never anticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothing more than YC funding. If founders decide VCs aren't worth the trouble, that could be bad for VCs. When the economy bounces back in a few years and they're ready to write checks again, they may find that founders have moved on. There is a founder community just as there's a VC community. They all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them. If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider and gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it. And the same is true for funding. The current generation of founders want to raise money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically, because Larry and Sergey took money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically. Imagine what it would do to the VC business if the next hot company didn't take VC at all. VCs think they're playing a zero sum game. In fact, it's not even that. If you lose a deal to Benchmark, you lose that deal, but VC as an industry still wins. If you lose a deal to None, all VCs lose. This recession may be different from the one after the Internet Bubble. This time founders may keep starting startups. And if they do, VCs will have to keep writing checks, or they could become irrelevant. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, David Hornik, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this. March 2021 The secret curse of the nonprofit world is restricted donations. If you haven't been involved with nonprofits, you may never have heard this phrase before. But if you have been, it probably made you wince. Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can be done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhaps the default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the donor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have chosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the donation. But who has a better understanding of where money needs to be spent, the nonprofit or the donor? If a nonprofit doesn't understand better than its donors where money needs to be spent, then it's incompetent and you shouldn't be donating to it at all. Which means a restricted donation is inherently suboptimal. It's either a donation to a bad nonprofit, or a donation for the wrong things. There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the nonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a restricted donation to a university, for example, because a university is only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the donor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money needs to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific goals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits to accomplish them. But unless you're a domain expert yourself or donating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do more good if it were unrestricted. If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why do donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn't donors' only motive. They often have other motives as well — to make a mark, or to generate good publicity [1], or to comply with regulations or corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. They may believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just how donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard to discourage such illusions. They can't afford to. People running nonprofits are almost always anxious about money. They can't afford to talk back to big donors. You can't expect candor in a relationship so asymmetric. So I'll tell you what nonprofits wish they could tell you. If you want to donate to a nonprofit, donate unrestricted. If you trust them to spend your money, trust them to decide how. **Note** [1] Unfortunately restricted donations tend to generate more publicity than unrestricted ones. \"X donates money to build a school in Africa\" is not only more interesting than \"X donates money to Y nonprofit to spend as Y chooses,\" but also focuses more attention on X. **Thanks** to Chase Adam, Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell, and Edith Elliot for reading drafts of this. **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). July 2013 One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the market must not exist. [1] Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a separate and laborious process to get it going. **Recruit** The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them. Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the problem they solved was an urgent one. If anyone could have sat back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they're famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition. Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of potential users in the other companies we've funded, and none took better advantage of it than Stripe. At YC we use the term \"Collison installation\" for the technique they invented. More diffident founders ask \"Will you try our beta?\" and if the answer is yes, they say \"Great, we'll send you a link.\" But the Collison brothers weren't going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say \"Right then, give me your laptop\" and set them up on the spot. There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually. One is a combination of shyness and laziness. They'd rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of strangers and probably be rejected by most of them. But for a startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing. [2] The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute numbers seem so small at first. This can't be how the big, famous startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to underestimate the power of compound growth. We encourage every startup to measure their progress by weekly [growth rate](growth.html). If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10% a week. And while 110 may not seem much better than 100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big the numbers get. After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after 2 years you'll have 2 million. You'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users a thousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually. But if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users manually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. [3] Airbnb is a classic example of this technique. Marketplaces are so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures at first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door in New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve their listings. When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture them with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners they'd always just flown back from somewhere. **Fragile** Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in person with users made the difference between success and failure. That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb. Almost all startups are fragile initially. And that's one of the biggest things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them. They unconsciously judge larval startups by the standards of established ones. They're like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding \"there's no way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything.\" It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup. They always get things wrong. It's even ok if investors dismiss your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth. The big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself. I've seen it happen. I often have to encourage founders who don't see the full potential of what they're building. Even Bill Gates made that mistake. He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting Microsoft. He didn't stay long, but he wouldn't have returned at all if he'd realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of the size it turned out to be. [4] The question to ask about an early stage startup is not \"is this company taking over the world?\" but \"how big could this company get if the founders did the right things?\" And the right things often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoft can't have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few thousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect that was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software. And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn't feel like they were en route to the big time as they were taking \"professional\" photos of their first hosts' apartments. They were just trying to survive. But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big market. How do you find users to recruit manually? If you build something to solve [your own problems](startupideas.html), then you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward. Otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate the most promising vein of users. The usual way to do that is to get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted launch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and seek out more like them. For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that a lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design, so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and that worked well. [5] **Delight** You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users, but also to make them happy. For as long as they could (which turned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user a hand-written thank you note. Your first users should feel that signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made. And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways to delight them. Why do we have to teach startups this? Why is it counterintuitive for founders? Three reasons, I think. One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers, and customer service is not part of the training of engineers. You're supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not be slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of salesperson. Ironically, part of the reason engineering is traditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date from a time when engineers were less powerful — when they were only in charge of their narrow domain of building things, rather than running the whole show. You can be ornery when you're Scotty, but not when you're Kirk. Another reason founders don't focus enough on individual customers is that they worry it won't scale. But when founders of larval startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state they have nothing to lose. Maybe if they go out of their way to make existing users super happy, they'll one day have too many to do so much for. That would be a great problem to have. See if you can make it happen. And incidentally, when it does, you'll find that delighting customers scales better than you expected. Partly because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than you would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers will by then have permeated your culture. I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying too hard to make their initial users happy. But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing how attentive they could be to their users is that they've never experienced such attention themselves. Their standards for customer service have been set by the companies they've been customers of, which are mostly big ones. Tim Cook doesn't send you a hand-written note after you buy a laptop. He can't. But you can. That's one advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big company can. [6] Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound on user experience, it's interesting in a very pleasant way to think about how far you could go to delight your users. **Experience** I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it: insanely great. Steve wasn't just using \"insanely\" as a synonym for \"very.\" He meant it more literally — that one should focus on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be considered pathological. All the most successful startups we've funded have, and that probably doesn't surprise would-be founders. What novice founders don't get is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup. When Steve Jobs started using that phrase, Apple was already an established company. He meant the Mac (and its documentation and even packaging — such is the nature of obsession) should be insanely well designed and manufactured. That's not hard for engineers to grasp. It's just a more extreme version of designing a robust and elegant product. What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself might have had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great morphs into as you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a startup's life. It's not the product that should be insanely great, but the experience of being your user. The product is just one component of that. For a big company it's necessarily the dominant one. But you can and should give users an insanely great experience with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the difference with attentiveness. Can, perhaps, but should? Yes. Over-engaging with early users is not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling. For most successful startups it's a necessary part of the feedback loop that makes the product good. Making a better mousetrap is not an atomic operation. Even if you start the way most successful startups have, by building something you yourself need, the first thing you build is never quite right. And except in domains with big penalties for making mistakes, it's often better not to aim for perfection initially. In software, especially, it usually works best to get something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility, and then see what they do with it. Perfectionism is often an excuse for procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users is always inaccurate, even if you're one of them. [7] The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get. When you're so big you have to resort to focus groups, you'll wish you could go over to your users' homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when there were only a handful of them. **Fire** Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately narrow market. It's like keeping a fire contained at first to get it really hot before adding more logs. That's what Facebook did. At first it was just for Harvard students. In that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people, but because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass of them signed up. After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students, it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while. When I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said that while it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school, doing that made students feel the site was their natural home. Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has to start in a subset of the market, but this can work for other startups as well. It's always worth asking if there's a subset of the market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly. [8] Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously. They build something for themselves and their friends, who happen to be the early adopters, and only realize later that they could offer it to a broader market. The strategy works just as well if you do it unconsciously. The biggest danger of not being consciously aware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it. E.g. if you don't build something for yourself and your friends, or even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and your friends are not early adopters, you'll no longer have a perfect initial market handed to you on a platter. Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups. They're more open to new things both by nature and because, having just been started, they haven't made all their choices yet. Plus when they succeed they grow fast, and you with them. It was one of many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically of making YC big) that B2B startups now have an instant market of hundreds of other startups ready at hand. **Meraki** For [hardware startups](hw.html) there's a variant of doing things that don't scale that we call \"pulling a Meraki.\" Although we didn't fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris's grad students, so we know their history. They got started by doing something that really doesn't scale: assembling their routers themselves. Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don't. The minimum order for a factory production run is usually several hundred thousand dollars. Which can put you in a catch-22: without a product you can't generate the growth you need to raise the money to manufacture your product. Back when hardware startups had to rely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing to overcome this. The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely, preorders) has helped a lot. But even so I'd advise startups to pull a Meraki initially if they can. That's what Pebble did. The Pebbles [assembled](https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/eric.jpg?t=1730199416&) the first several hundred watches themselves. If they hadn't gone through that phase, they probably wouldn't have sold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter. Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups. You can tweak the design faster when you're the factory, and you learn things you'd never have known otherwise. Eric Migicovsky of Pebble said one of the things he learned was \"how valuable it was to source good screws.\" Who knew? **Consult** Sometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement to an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as if they were consultants building something just for that one user. The initial user serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit their needs perfectly, and you'll usually find you've made something other users want too. Even if there aren't many of them, there are probably adjacent territories that have more. As long as you can find just one user who really needs something and can act on that need, you've got a toehold in making something people want, and that's as much as any startup needs initially. [9] Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale. But (like other ways of bestowing one's favors liberally) it's safe to do it so long as you're not being paid to. That's where companies cross the line. So long as you're a product company that's merely being extra attentive to a customer, they're very grateful even if you don't solve all their problems. But when they start paying you specifically for that attentiveness — when they start paying you by the hour — they expect you to do everything. Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm users is to use your software yourselves on their behalf. We did that at Viaweb. When we approached merchants asking if they wanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, but they'd let us make one for them. Since we would do anything to get users, we did. We felt pretty lame at the time. Instead of organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying to sell luggage and pens and men's shirts. But in retrospect it was exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it would feel to merchants to use our software. Sometimes the feedback loop was near instantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant's site I'd find I needed a feature we didn't have, so I'd spend a couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site. **Manual** There's a more extreme variant where you don't just use your software, but are your software. When you only have a small number of users, you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan to automate later. This lets you launch faster, and when you do finally automate yourself out of the loop, you'll know exactly what to build because you'll have muscle memory from doing it yourself. When manual components look to the user like software, this technique starts to have aspects of a practical joke. For example, the way Stripe delivered \"instant\" merchant accounts to its first users was that the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant accounts behind the scenes. Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find someone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then gradually automate the bottlenecks. It would be a little frightening to be solving users' problems in a way that wasn't yet automatic, but less frightening than the far more common case of having something automatic that doesn't yet solve anyone's problems. **Big** I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn't work: the Big Launch. I occasionally meet founders who seem to believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and that they'll make it big if and only if they're launched with sufficient initial velocity. They want to launch simultaneously in 8 different publications, with embargoes. And on a tuesday, of course, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to launch something. It's easy to see how little launches matter. Think of some successful startups. How many of their launches do you remember? All you need from a launch is some initial core of users. How well you're doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you made those users than how many there were of them. [10] So why do founders think launches matter? A combination of solipsism and laziness. They think what they're building is so great that everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up. Plus it would be so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcasting your existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time. But even if what you're building really is great, getting users will always be a gradual process — partly because great things are usually also novel, but mainly because users have other things to think about. Partnerships too usually don't work. They don't work for startups in general, but they especially don't work as a way to get growth started. It's a common mistake among inexperienced founders to believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big break. Six months later they're all saying the same thing: that was way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting practically nothing out of it. [11] It's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially. You have to make an extraordinary _effort_ initially. Any strategy that omits the effort — whether it's expecting a big launch to get you users, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect. **Vector** The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of startup ideas as scalars. Instead we should try thinking of them as pairs of what you're going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s) you're going to do initially to get the company going. It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way, because now that there are two components you can try to be imaginative about the second as well as the first. But in most cases the second component will be what it usually is — recruit users manually and give them an overwhelmingly good experience — and the main benefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind founders they need to work hard in two dimensions. [12] In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your company's DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get started are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently for the better. If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition when you're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're big. If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your software on users's behalf, you'll learn things you couldn't have learned otherwise. And most importantly, if you have to work hard to delight users when you only have a handful of them, you'll keep doing it when you have a lot. **Notes** [1] Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically. He wrote \"If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.\" [2] Thanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit. And no, you can't avoid doing sales by hiring someone to do it for you. You have to do sales yourself initially. Later you can hire a real salesperson to replace you. [3] The reason this works is that as you get bigger, your size helps you grow. Patrick Collison wrote \"At some point, there was a very noticeable change in how Stripe felt. It tipped from being this boulder we had to push to being a train car that in fact had its own momentum.\" [4] One of the more subtle ways in which YC can help founders is by calibrating their ambitions, because we know exactly how a lot of successful startups looked when they were just getting started. [5] If you're building something for which you can't easily get a small set of users to observe — e.g. enterprise software — and in a domain where you have no connections, you'll have to rely on cold calls and introductions. But should you even be working on such an idea? [6] Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into in the beginning. They want so much to seem big that they imitate even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual users. This seems to them more \"professional.\" Actually it's better to embrace the fact that you're small and use whatever advantages that brings. [7] Your user model almost couldn't be perfectly accurate, because users' needs often change in response to what you build for them. Build them a microcomputer, and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets on it, because the arrival of your new microcomputer causes someone to invent the spreadsheet. [8] If you have to choose between the subset that will sign up quickest and those that will pay the most, it's usually best to pick the former, because those are probably the early adopters. They'll have a better influence on your product, and they won't make you expend as much effort on sales. And though they have less money, you don't need that much to maintain your target growth rate early on. [9] Yes, I can imagine cases where you could end up making something that was really only useful for one user. But those are usually obvious, even to inexperienced founders. So if it's not obvious you'd be making something for a market of one, don't worry about that danger. [10] There may even be an inverse correlation between launch magnitude and success. The only launches I remember are famous flops like the Segway and Google Wave. Wave is a particularly alarming example, because I think it was actually a great idea that was killed partly by its overdone launch. [11] Google grew big on the back of Yahoo, but that wasn't a partnership. Yahoo was their customer. [12] It will also remind founders that an idea where the second component is empty — an idea where there is nothing you can do to get going, e.g. because you have no way to find users to recruit manually — is probably a bad idea, at least for those founders. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Kevin Hale, Steven Levy, Jessica Livingston, Geoff Ralston, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this. October 2020 One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. But many people don't. Most people don't even reach the stage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They're too frightened even to start. Imagine if we could turn off the fear of making something lame. Imagine how much more we'd do. Is there any hope of turning it off? I think so. I think the habits at work here are not very deeply rooted. Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any. We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't realize they're a special case. Or at least, most of us don't. One reason I'm confident we can do better is that it's already starting to happen. There are already a few places that are living in the future in this respect. Silicon Valley is one of them: an unknown person working on a strange-sounding idea won't automatically be dismissed the way they would back home. In Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is. The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge to your imagination  not just to have lower standards, but to [_switch polarity_](altair.html) entirely, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I meet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've had a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being practically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown people. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown at you and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a power-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious if you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes urgent. But I'm hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can become widespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trick used by a few specialists. It is after all an extremely lucrative trick, and those tend to spread quickly. Of course, inexperience is not the only reason people are too harsh on early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seem clever. And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups, those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Just not when their predictions are [_weighted by outcome_](swan.html). But there is another more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas. If you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope, consciously or unconsciously, that you'll fail. They worry that if you try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them. In some countries this is not just an individual failing but part of the national culture. I wouldn't claim that people in Silicon Valley overcome these impulses because they're morally better. [1] The reason many hope you'll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. For investors this incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeed because they hope you'll make them rich in the process. But many other people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from your success. At the very least they'll be able to say, when you're famous, that they've known you since way back. But even if Silicon Valley's encouraging attitude is rooted in self-interest, it has over time actually grown into a sort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced for so long that it has become a custom. Now it just seems that that's what one does with startups. Maybe Silicon Valley is too optimistic. Maybe it's too easily fooled by impostors. Many less optimistic journalists want to believe that. But the lists of impostors they cite are suspiciously short, and plagued with asterisks. [2] If you use revenue as the test, Silicon Valley's optimism seems better tuned than the rest of the world's. And because it works, it will spread. There's a lot more to new ideas than new startup ideas, of course. The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field. But Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support new ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is not so deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearnt. ___________ Unfortunately, if you want to do new things, you'll face a force more powerful than other people's skepticism: your own skepticism. You too will judge your early work too harshly. How do you avoid that? This is a difficult problem, because you don't want to completely eliminate your horror of making something lame. That's what steers you toward doing good work. You just want to turn it off temporarily, the way a painkiller temporarily turns off pain. People have already discovered several techniques that work. Hardy mentions two in _A Mathematician's Apology_ : > Good work is not done by \"humble\" men. It is one of the first duties of a > professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a little both the > importance of his subject and his importance in it. If you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial results. If you look at something that's 20% of the way to a goal worth 100 and conclude that it's 10% of the way to a goal worth 200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even though both components are wrong. It also helps, as Hardy suggests, to be slightly overconfident. I've noticed in many fields that the most successful people are slightly overconfident. On the face of it this seems implausible. Surely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate of one's abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken? Because this error compensates for other sources of error in the opposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you against both other people's skepticism and your own. Ignorance has a similar effect. It's safe to make the mistake of judging early work as finished work if you're a sufficiently lax judge of finished work. I doubt it's possible to cultivate this kind of ignorance, but empirically it's a real advantage, especially for the young. Another way to get through the lame phase of ambitious projects is to surround yourself with the right people  to create an eddy in the social headwind. But it's not enough to collect people who are always encouraging. You'd learn to discount that. You need colleagues who can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby swan. The people best able to do this are those working on similar projects of their own, which is why university departments and research labs work so well. You don't need institutions to collect colleagues. They naturally coalesce, given the chance. But it's very much worth accelerating this process by seeking out other people trying to do new things. Teachers are in effect a special case of colleagues. It's a teacher's job both to see the promise of early work and to encourage you to continue. But teachers who are good at this are unfortunately quite rare, so if you have the opportunity to learn from one, take it. [3] For some it might work to rely on sheer discipline: to tell yourself that you just have to press on through the initial crap phase and not get discouraged. But like a lot of \"just tell yourself\" advice, this is harder than it sounds. And it gets still harder as you get older, because your standards rise. The old do have one compensating advantage though: they've been through this before. It can help if you focus less on where you are and more on the rate of change. You won't worry so much about doing bad work if you can see it improving. Obviously the faster it improves, the easier this is. So when you start something new, it's good if you can spend a lot of time on it. That's another advantage of being young: you tend to have bigger blocks of time. Another common trick is to start by considering new work to be of a different, less exacting type. To start a painting saying that it's just a sketch, or a new piece of software saying that it's just a quick hack. Then you judge your initial results by a lower standard. Once the project is rolling you can sneakily convert it to something more. [4] This will be easier if you use a medium that lets you work fast and doesn't require too much commitment up front. It's easier to convince yourself that something is just a sketch when you're drawing in a notebook than when you're carving stone. Plus you get initial results faster. [5] [6] It will be easier to try out a risky project if you think of it as a way to learn and not just as a way to make something. Then even if the project truly is a failure, you'll still have gained by it. If the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself is knowledge: if the theorem you're trying to prove turns out to be false, or you use a structural member of a certain size and it fails under stress, you've learned something, even if it isn't what you wanted to learn. [7] One motivation that works particularly well for me is curiosity. I like to try new things just to see how they'll turn out. We started Y Combinator in this spirit, and it was one of main things that kept me going while I was working on [_Bel_](bel.html). Having worked for so long with various dialects of Lisp, I was very curious to see what its inherent shape was: what you'd end up with if you followed the axiomatic approach all the way. But it's a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself to avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thing you're trying to trick yourself into believing is in fact the truth. A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more valuable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teach yourself that. One way to do it is to study the histories of people who've done great work. What were they thinking early on? What was the very first thing they did? It can sometimes be hard to get an accurate answer to this question, because people are often embarrassed by their earliest work and make little effort to publish it. (They too misjudge it.) But when you can get an accurate picture of the first steps someone made on the path to some great work, they're often pretty feeble. [8] Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself to be a better judge of early work. Then you'll be immune both to other people's skepticism and your own fear of making something lame. You'll see early work for what it is. Curiously enough, the solution to the problem of judging early work too harshly is to realize that our attitudes toward it are themselves early work. Holding everything to the same standard is a crude version 1. We're already evolving better customs, and we can already see signs of how big the payoff will be. **Notes** [1] This assumption may be too conservative. There is some evidence that historically the Bay Area has attracted a [_different sort of person_](cities.html) than, say, New York City. [2] One of their great favorites is Theranos. But the most conspicuous feature of Theranos's cap table is the absence of Silicon Valley firms. Journalists were fooled by Theranos, but Silicon Valley investors weren't. [3] I made two mistakes about teachers when I was younger. I cared more about professors' research than their reputations as teachers, and I was also wrong about what it meant to be a good teacher. I thought it simply meant to be good at explaining things. [4] Patrick Collison points out that you can go past treating something as a hack in the sense of a prototype and onward to the sense of the word that means something closer to a practical joke: > I think there may be something related to being a hack that can be powerful >  the idea of making the tenuousness and implausibility _a feature_. \"Yes, > it's a bit ridiculous, right? I'm just trying to see how far such a naive > approach can get.\" YC seemed to me to have this characteristic. [5] Much of the advantage of switching from physical to digital media is not the software per se but that it lets you start something new with little upfront commitment. [6] John Carmack adds: > The value of a medium without a vast gulf between the early work and the > final work is exemplified in game mods. The original Quake game was a golden > age for mods, because everything was very flexible, but so crude due to > technical limitations, that quick hacks to try out a gameplay idea weren't > all _that_ far from the official game.

December 2020 Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance when we're talking about startups. The highest compliment we can pay to founders is to describe them as \"earnest.\" This is not by itself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable. But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and earnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get. Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems a bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care about it. Why does this matter so much? When you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their motives. It means both that they're doing something for the right reasons, and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine motives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude are right. Though these are of course related: when people are doing something for the right reasons, they try harder. [1] The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many people there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startup makes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people trying to start them are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of interest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of earnestness. [2] It's also the hallmark of a nerd. Indeed, when people describe themselves as \"x nerds,\" what they mean is that they're interested in x for its own sake, and not because it's cool to be interested in x, or because of what they can get from it. They're saying they care so much about x that they're willing to sacrifice seeming cool for its sake. A [_genuine interest_](genius.html) in something is a very powerful motivator  for some people, the most powerful motivator of all. [3] Which is why it's what Jessica and I look for in founders. But as well as being a source of strength, it's also a source of vulnerability. Caring constrains you. The earnest can't easily reply in kind to mocking banter, or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care too much. They are doomed to be the straight man. That's a real disadvantage in your [_teenage years_](nerds.html), when mocking banter and nihil admirari often have the upper hand. But it becomes an advantage later. It's a commonplace now that the kids who were nerds in high school become the cool kids' bosses later on. But people misunderstand why this happens. It's not just because the nerds are smarter, but also because they're more earnest. When the problems get harder than the fake ones you're given in high school, caring about them starts to matter. Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always. It probably doesn't matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certain types of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personal injury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in academic fields at the more [_bogus_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=hermeneutic+dialectics+hegemonic+phenomenology+intersectionality) end of the spectrum. And though I don't know enough to say for sure, it may not matter in some kinds of humor: it may be possible to be completely cynical and still be very funny. [4] Looking at the list of fields I mentioned, there's an obvious pattern. Except possibly for humor, these are all types of work I'd avoid like the plague. So that could be a useful heuristic for deciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter? Which can in turn presumably be inferred from the prevalence of nerds at the top. Along with \"nerd,\" another word that tends to be associated with earnestness is \"naive.\" The earnest often seem naive. It's not just that they don't have the motives other people have. They often don't fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may know intellectually that they do, but because they don't feel them, they forget about them. [5] It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also, believe it or not, about the problems you're working on. Naive optimism can compensate for the bit rot that [_rapid change_](ecw.html) causes in established beliefs. You plunge into some problem saying \"How hard can it be? \", and then after solving it you learn that it was till recently insoluble. Naivete is an obstacle for anyone who wants to seem sophisticated, and this is one reason would-be intellectuals find it so difficult to understand Silicon Valley. It hasn't been safe for such people to use the word \"earnest\" outside scare quotes since Oscar Wilde wrote \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in 1895. And yet when you zoom in on Silicon Valley, right into [_Jessica Livingston's brain_](jessica.html), that's what her x-ray vision is seeking out in founders. Earnestness! Who'd have guessed? Reporters literally can't believe it when founders making piles of money say that they started their companies to make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery. How can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausible they sound? Though those asking this question don't realize it, that's not a rhetorical question. A lot of founders are faking it, of course, particularly the smaller fry, and the soon to be smaller fry. But not all of them. There are a significant number of founders who really are interested in the problem they're solving mainly for its own sake. Why shouldn't there be? We have no difficulty believing that people would be interested in history or math or even old bus tickets for their own sake. Why can't there be people interested in self-driving cars or social networks for their own sake? When you look at the question from this side, it seems obvious there would be. And isn't it likely that having a deep interest in something would be a source of great energy and resilience? It is in every other field. The question really is why we have a blind spot about business. And the answer to that is obvious if you know enough history. For most of history, making large amounts of money has not been very intellectually interesting. In preindustrial times it was never far from robbery, and some areas of business still retain that character, except using lawyers instead of soldiers. But there are other areas of business where the work is genuinely interesting. Henry Ford got to spend much of his time working on interesting technical problems, and for the last several decades the trend in that direction has been accelerating. It's much easier now to make a lot of money by working on something you're interested in than it was [_50 years ago_](re.html). And that, rather than how fast they grow, may be the most important change that startups represent. Though indeed, the fact that the work is genuinely interesting is a big part of why it gets done so fast. [6] Can you imagine a more important change than one in the relationship between intellectual curiosity and money? These are two of the most powerful forces in the world, and in my lifetime they've become significantly more aligned. How could you not be fascinated to watch something like this happening in real time? I meant this essay to be about earnestness generally, and now I've gone and talked about startups again. But I suppose at least it serves as an example of an x nerd in the wild. **Notes** [1] It's interesting how many different ways there are _not_ to be earnest: to be cleverly cynical, to be superficially brilliant, to be conspicuously virtuous, to be cool, to be sophisticated, to be orthodox, to be a snob, to bully, to pander, to be on the make. This pattern suggests that earnestness is not one end of a continuum, but a target one can fall short of in multiple dimensions. Another thing I notice about this list is that it sounds like a list of the ways people behave on Twitter. Whatever else social media is, it's a vivid catalogue of ways not to be earnest. [2] People's motives are as mixed in Silicon Valley as anywhere else. Even the founders motivated mostly by money tend to be at least somewhat interested in the problem they're solving, and even the founders most interested in the problem they're solving also like the idea of getting rich. But there's great variation in the relative proportions of different founders' motivations. And when I talk about \"wrong\" motives, I don't mean morally wrong. There's nothing morally wrong with starting a startup to make money. I just mean that those startups don't do as well. [3] The most powerful motivator for most people is probably family. But there are some for whom intellectual curiosity comes first. In his (wonderful) autobiography, Paul Halmos says explicitly that for a mathematician, math must come before anything else, including family. Which at least implies that it did for him. [4] Interestingly, just as the word \"nerd\" implies earnestness even when used as a metaphor, the word \"politics\" implies the opposite. It's not only in actual politics that earnestness seems to be a handicap, but also in office politics and academic politics. [5] It's a bigger social error to seem naive in most European countries than it is in America, and this may be one of subtler reasons startups are less common there. Founder culture is completely at odds with sophisticated cynicism. The most earnest part of Europe is Scandinavia, and not surprisingly this is also the region with the highest number of successful startups per capita. [6] Much of business is schleps, and probably always will be. But even being a professor is largely schleps. It would be interesting to collect statistics about the schlep ratios of different jobs, but I suspect they'd rarely be less than 30%. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Suhail Doshi, Jessica Livingston, Mattias Ljungman, Harj Taggar, and Kyle Vogt for reading drafts of this. July 2007 An investor wants to give you money for a certain percentage of your startup. Should you take it? You're about to hire your first employee. How much stock should you give him? These are some of the hardest questions founders face. And yet both have the same answer: 1/(1 - n) Whenever you're trading stock in your company for anything, whether it's money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test for whether to do it is the same. You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before. For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how much does that investment have to improve your average outcome for you to break even? Obviously it has to double: if you trade half your company for something that more than doubles the company's average outcome, you're net ahead. You have half as big a share of something worth more than twice as much. In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth more than 1/(1 - n). For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for 7% of your company. In this case, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075. So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your average outcome by more than 7.5%. If we improve your outcome by 10%, you're net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth .93 x 1.1 = 1.023. [1] One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal. Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company. 1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve your outcome by more than 43%. For the average startup, that would be an extraordinary bargain. It would improve the average startup's prospects by more than 43% just to be able to _say_ they were funded by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money. The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of the company they take is artificially low. They don't even try to get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still theirs. The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and funds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are 1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups. Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal. It's never just a straight trade of money for stock. But if it were, taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain. You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but it works in the other direction. If i is the average outcome for the company with the addition of some new person, then they're worth n such that i = 1/(1 - n). Which means n = (i - 1)/i. For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire an additional hacker who's so good you feel he'll increase the average outcome of the whole company by 20%. n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 = .167. So you'll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company for him. That doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him. Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's usually salary and overhead as well. And if the company merely breaks even on the deal, there's no reason to do it. I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about 1.5. Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation, which should be 3x this year's. If your valuation grows 3x a year, the total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5 years' cost at the present valuation. [2] How much of an additional margin should the company need as the \"activation energy\" for the deal? Since this is in effect the company's profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if you're a hot opportunity, you can charge more. Let's run through an example. Suppose the company wants to make a \"profit\" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above. So subtract a third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his \"retail\" price. Suppose further that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead, x 1.5 = $90k total. If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4.5%. 11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%. Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to take little salary. It comes right out of stock that could otherwise be given to them. Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers. I'm not claiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula. Ultimately you always have to guess. But at least know what you're guessing. If you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typical grant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates of. And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity, run it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense. You should always feel richer after trading equity. If the trade didn't increase the value of your remaining shares enough to put you net ahead, you wouldn't have (or shouldn't have) done it. **Notes** [1] This is why we can't believe anyone would think Y Combinator was a bad deal. Does anyone really think we're so useless that in three months we can't improve a startup's prospects by 7.5%? [2] The obvious choice for your present valuation is the post-money valuation of your last funding round. This probably undervalues the company, though, because (a) unless your last round just happened, the company is presumably worth more, and (b) the valuation of an early funding round usually reflects some other contribution by the investors. **Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Hutch Fishman, David Hornik, Paul Kedrosky, Jessica Livingston, Gary Sabot, and Joshua Schachter for reading drafts of this. September 2004 Remember the essays you had to write in high school? Topic sentence, introductory paragraph, supporting paragraphs, conclusion. The conclusion being, say, that Ahab in _Moby Dick_ was a Christ-like figure. Oy. So I'm going to try to give the other side of the story: what an essay really is, and how you write one. Or at least, how I write one. **Mods** The most obvious difference between real essays and the things one has to write in school is that real essays are not exclusively about English literature. Certainly schools should teach students how to write. But due to a series of historical accidents the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature. And so all over the country students are writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens. With the result that writing is made to seem boring and pointless. Who cares about symbolism in Dickens? Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay about color or baseball. How did things get this way? To answer that we have to go back almost a thousand years. Around 1100, Europe at last began to catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered what we call \"the classics.\" The effect was rather as if we were visited by beings from another solar system. These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated that for the next several centuries the main work of European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate what they knew. During this period the study of ancient texts acquired great prestige. It seemed the essence of what scholars did. As European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important; by 1350 someone who wanted to learn about science could find better teachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1] But schools change slower than scholarship. In the 19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone of the curriculum. The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern texts? The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer. The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that those studying the classics were, if not wasting their time, at least working on problems of minor importance. And so began the study of modern literature. There was a good deal of resistance at first. The first courses in English literature seem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly American ones. Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst, and University College, London taught English literature in the 1820s. But Harvard didn't have a professor of English literature until 1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese before it had one of English.) [2] What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have been the idea that professors should do research as well as teach. This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly. Writing was one of the casualties. Colleges had long taught English composition. But how do you do research on composition? The professors who taught math could be required to do original math, the professors who taught history could be required to write scholarly articles about history, but what about the professors who taught rhetoric or composition? What should they do research on? The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3] And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited by English professors. This had two drawbacks: (a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer, any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b) the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that's what the professor is interested in. High schools imitate universities. The seeds of our miserable high school experiences were sown in 1892, when the National Education Association \"formally recommended that literature and composition be unified in the high school course.\" [4] The 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English, with the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before. It's no wonder if this seems to the student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps removed from real work: the students are imitating English professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work. **No Defense** The other big difference between a real essay and the things they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't take a position and then defend it. That principle, like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature, turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long forgotten origins. It's often mistakenly believed that medieval universities were mostly seminaries. In fact they were more law schools. And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates, trained to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it as they can. Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded early universities. The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum. [5] And after the lecture the most common form of discussion was the disputation. This is at least nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense: most people treat the words thesis and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it. Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth, as I think lawyers would be the first to admit. It's not just that you miss subtleties this way. The real problem is that you can't change the question. And yet this principle is built into the very structure of the things they teach you to write in high school. The topic sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the conclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion? I was never sure about that in high school. It seemed as if we were just supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph, but in different enough words that no one could tell. Why bother? But when you understand the origins of this sort of \"essay,\" you can see where the conclusion comes from. It's the concluding remarks to the jury. Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it should be convincing because you got the right answers, not because you did a good job of arguing. When I give a draft of an essay to friends, there are two things I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem unconvincing. The boring bits can usually be fixed by cutting. But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by arguing more cleverly. I need to talk the matter over. At the very least I must have explained something badly. In that case, in the course of the conversation I'll be forced to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just incorporate in the essay. More often than not I have to change what I was saying as well. But the aim is never to be convincing per se. As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical, so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth. The sort of writing that attempts to persuade may be a valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it's historically inaccurate to call it an essay. An essay is something else. **Trying** To understand what a real essay is, we have to reach back into history again, though this time not so far. To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of what he called \"essais.\" He was doing something quite different from what lawyers do, and the difference is embodied in the name. _Essayer_ is the French verb meaning \"to try\" and an _essai_ is an attempt. An essay is something you write to try to figure something out. Figure out what? You don't know yet. And so you can't begin with a thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have one. An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a question. In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it. You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside. If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though? Why not just sit and think? Well, there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery. Expressing ideas helps to form them. Indeed, helps is far too weak a word. Most of what ends up in my essays I only thought of when I sat down to write them. That's why I write them. In the things you write in school you are, in theory, merely explaining yourself to the reader. In a real essay you're writing for yourself. You're thinking out loud. But not quite. Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to think well. So it does matter to have an audience. The things I've written just for myself are no good. They tend to peter out. When I run into difficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea. Many published essays peter out in the same way. Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines. Outside writers tend to supply editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which make a beeline toward a rousing (and foreordained) conclusion. But the staff writers feel obliged to write something \"balanced.\" Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the most radioactively controversial questions, from which-- because they're writing for a popular magazine-- they then proceed to recoil in terror. Abortion, for or against? This group says one thing. That group says another. One thing is certain: the question is a complex one. (But don't get mad at us. We didn't draw any conclusions.) **The River** Questions aren't enough. An essay has to come up with answers. They don't always, of course. Sometimes you start with a promising question and get nowhere. But those you don't publish. Those are like experiments that get inconclusive results. An essay you publish ought to tell the reader something he didn't already know. But _what_ you tell him doesn't matter, so long as it's interesting. I'm sometimes accused of meandering. In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw. There you're not concerned with truth. You already know where you're going, and you want to go straight there, blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving your way across swampy ground. But that's not what you're trying to do in an essay. An essay is supposed to be a search for truth. It would be suspicious if it didn't meander. The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey. As you might expect, it winds all over the place. But it doesn't do this out of frivolity. The path it has discovered is the most economical route to the sea. [6] The river's algorithm is simple. At each step, flow down. For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting. Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting. One can't have quite as little foresight as a river. I always know generally what I want to write about. But not the specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to paragraph I let the ideas take their course. This doesn't always work. Sometimes, like a river, one runs up against a wall. Then I do the same thing the river does: backtrack. At one point in this essay I found that after following a certain thread I ran out of ideas. I had to go back seven paragraphs and start over in another direction. Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-up train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation. Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts. It would be exhausting to read. You need to cut and fill to emphasize the central thread, like an illustrator inking over a pencil drawing. But don't change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original. Err on the side of the river. An essay is not a reference work. It's not something you read looking for a specific answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it. I'd much rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along a prescribed course. **Surprise** So what's interesting? For me, interesting means surprise. Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle of least astonishment. A button that looks like it will make a machine stop should make it stop, not speed up. Essays should do the opposite. Essays should aim for maximum surprise. I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel vicariously. When friends came back from faraway places, it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked what they saw. I really wanted to know. And I found the best way to get information out of them was to ask what surprised them. How was the place different from what they expected? This is an extremely useful question. You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will extract information they didn't even know they were recording. Surprises are things that you not only didn't know, but that contradict things you thought you knew. And so they're the most valuable sort of fact you can get. They're like a food that's not merely healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things you've already eaten. How do you find surprises? Well, therein lies half the work of essay writing. (The other half is expressing yourself well.) The trick is to use yourself as a proxy for the reader. You should only write about things you've thought about a lot. And anything you come across that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably surprise most readers. For example, in a recent [essay](gh.html) I pointed out that because you can only judge computer programmers by working with them, no one knows who the best programmers are overall. I didn't realize this when I began that essay, and even now I find it kind of weird. That's what you're looking for. So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients: a few topics you've thought about a lot, and some ability to ferret out the unexpected. What should you think about? My guess is that it doesn't matter-- that anything can be interesting if you get deeply enough into it. One possible exception might be things that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them, like working in fast food. In retrospect, was there anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins? Well, it was interesting how important color was to the customers. Kids a certain age would point into the case and say that they wanted yellow. Did they want French Vanilla or Lemon? They would just look at you blankly. They wanted yellow. And then there was the mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines 'n' Cream was so appealing. (I think now it was the salt.) And the difference in the way fathers and mothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fathers like benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothers harried, giving in to pressure. So, yes, there does seem to be some material even in fast food. I didn't notice those things at the time, though. At sixteen I was about as observant as a lump of rock. I can see more now in the fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I could see at the time from having it all happening live, right in front of me. **Observation** So the ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be an inborn one. It must be something you can learn. How do you learn it? To some extent it's like learning history. When you first read history, it's just a whirl of names and dates. Nothing seems to stick. But the more you learn, the more hooks you have for new facts to stick onto-- which means you accumulate knowledge at an exponential rate. Once you remember that Normans conquered England in 1066, it will catch your attention when you hear that other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the same time. Which will make you wonder about Normandy, and take note when a third book mentions that Normans were not, like most of what is now called France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire collapsed, but Vikings (norman = north man) who arrived four centuries later in 911. Which makes it easier to remember that Dublin was also established by Vikings in the 840s. Etc, etc squared. Collecting surprises is a similar process. The more anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll notice new ones. Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older, life should become more and more surprising. When I was a kid, I used to think adults had it all figured out. I had it backwards. Kids are the ones who have it all figured out. They're just mistaken. When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer. But (as with wealth) there may be habits of mind that will help the process along. It's good to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions beginning with Why. But not in the random way that three year olds ask why. There are an infinite number of questions. How do you find the fruitful ones? I find it especially useful to ask why about things that seem wrong. For example, why should there be a connection between humor and misfortune? Why do we find it funny when a character, even one we like, slips on a banana peel? There's a whole essay's worth of surprises there for sure. If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you'll find a degree of skepticism helpful. I take it as an axiom that we're only achieving 1% of what we could. This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our heads as children: that things are the way they are because that is how things have to be. For example, everyone I've talked to while writing this essay felt the same about English classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless. But none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize that it was, in fact, all a mistake. We all thought there was just something we weren't getting. I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things that seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way. I'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they read a draft of an essay. But why should I be? I'm aiming for good ideas. Why should good ideas be funny? The connection may be surprise. Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what one wants to deliver. I write down things that surprise me in notebooks. I never actually get around to reading them and using what I've written, but I do tend to reproduce the same thoughts later. So the main value of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your head. People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantage when collecting surprises. To be surprised is to be mistaken. And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tell you, is _nil admirari._ When you're mistaken, don't dwell on it; just act like nothing's wrong and maybe no one will notice. One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations where inexperience may make you look foolish. If you want to find surprises you should do the opposite. Study lots of different things, because some of the most interesting surprises are unexpected connections between different fields. For example, jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasing of foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation. And so were books and paintings. Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economic history, not political history. History seems to me so important that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study. Another way to describe it is _all the data we have so far._ Among other things, studying history gives one confidence that there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses. Swords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers, which (like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from the blade. Because swords are longer the hilts kept breaking off. But it took five hundred years before someone thought of casting hilt and blade as one piece. **Disobedience** Above all, make a habit of paying attention to things you're not supposed to, either because they're \"[inappropriate](say.html),\" or not important, or not what you're supposed to be working on. If you're curious about something, trust your instincts. Follow the threads that attract your attention. If there's something you're really interested in, you'll find they have an uncanny way of leading back to it anyway, just as the conversation of people who are especially proud of something always tends to lead back to it. For example, I've always been fascinated by comb-overs, especially the extreme sort that make a man look as if he's wearing a beret made of his own hair. Surely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in-- the sort of superficial quizzing best left to teenage girls. And yet there is something underneath. The key question, I realized, is how does the comber-over not see how odd he looks? And the answer is that he got to look that way _incrementally._ What began as combing his hair a little carefully over a thin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a monstrosity. Gradualness is very powerful. And that power can be used for constructive purposes too: just as you can trick yourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself into creating something so grand that you would never have dared to _plan_ such a thing. Indeed, this is just how most good software gets created. You start by writing a stripped-down kernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it grows into a complete operating system. Hence the next leap: could you do the same thing in painting, or in a novel? See what you can extract from a frivolous question? If there's one piece of advice I would give about writing essays, it would be: don't do as you're told. Don't believe what you're supposed to. Don't write the essay readers expect; one learns nothing from what one expects. And don't write the way they taught you to in school. The most important sort of disobedience is to write essays at all. Fortunately, this sort of disobedience shows signs of becoming [rampant](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1056050270.php). It used to be that only a tiny number of officially approved writers were allowed to write essays. Magazines published few of them, and judged them less by what they said than who wrote them; a magazine might publish a story by an unknown writer if it was good enough, but if they published an essay on x it had to be by someone who was at least forty and whose job title had x in it. Which is a problem, because there are a lot of things insiders can't say precisely because they're insiders. The Internet is changing that. Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as any writing should, by what it says, not who wrote it. Who are you to write about x? You are whatever you wrote. Popular magazines made the period between the spread of literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of the short story. The Web may well make this the golden age of the essay. And that's certainly not something I realized when I started writing this. **Notes** [1] I'm thinking of Oresme (c. 1323-82). But it's hard to pick a date, because there was a sudden drop-off in scholarship just as Europeans finished assimilating classical science. The cause may have been the plague of 1347; the trend in scientific progress matches the population curve.

At first literature took a back seat to philology, which (a) seemed more serious and (b) was popular in Germany, where many of the leading scholars of that generation had been trained. In some cases the writing teachers were transformed _in situ_ into English professors. Francis James Child, who had been Boylston Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard since 1851, became in 1876 the university's first professor of English. [4] Parker, _op. cit._ , p. 25. [5] The undergraduate curriculum or _trivium_ (whence \"trivial\") consisted of Latin grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Candidates for masters' degrees went on to study the _quadrivium_ of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Together these were the seven liberal arts. The study of rhetoric was inherited directly from Rome, where it was considered the most important subject. It would not be far from the truth to say that education in the classical world meant training landowners' sons to speak well enough to defend their interests in political and legal disputes. [6] Trevor Blackwell points out that this isn't strictly true, because the outside edges of curves erode faster. **Thanks** to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. August 2003 We may be able to improve the accuracy of Bayesian spam filters by having them follow links to see what's waiting at the other end. Richard Jowsey of [death2spam](http://death2spam.com) now does this in borderline cases, and reports that it works well. Why only do it in borderline cases? And why only do it once? As I mentioned in [Will Filters Kill Spam? ](wfks.html), following all the urls in a spam would have an amusing side-effect. If popular email clients did this in order to filter spam, the spammer's servers would take a serious pounding. The more I think about this, the better an idea it seems. This isn't just amusing; it would be hard to imagine a more perfectly targeted counterattack on spammers. So I'd like to suggest an additional feature to those working on spam filters: a \"punish\" mode which, if turned on, would spider every url in a suspected spam n times, where n could be set by the user. [1] As many people have noted, one of the problems with the current email system is that it's too passive. It does whatever you tell it. So far all the suggestions for fixing the problem seem to involve new protocols. This one wouldn't. If widely used, auto-retrieving spam filters would make the email system _rebound._ The huge volume of the spam, which has so far worked in the spammer's favor, would now work against him, like a branch snapping back in his face. Auto-retrieving spam filters would drive the spammer's [costs](http://www.bork.ca/pics/?path=incoming&img=bill.jpg) up, and his sales down: his bandwidth usage would go through the roof, and his servers would grind to a halt under the load, which would make them unavailable to the people who would have responded to the spam. Pump out a million emails an hour, get a million hits an hour on your servers. We would want to ensure that this is only done to suspected spams. As a rule, any url sent to millions of people is likely to be a spam url, so submitting every http request in every email would work fine nearly all the time. But there are a few cases where this isn't true: the urls at the bottom of mails sent from free email services like Yahoo Mail and Hotmail, for example. To protect such sites, and to prevent abuse, auto-retrieval should be combined with blacklists of spamvertised sites. Only sites on a blacklist would get crawled, and sites would be blacklisted only after being inspected by humans. The lifetime of a spam must be several hours at least, so it should be easy to update such a list in time to interfere with a spam promoting a new site. [2] High-volume auto-retrieval would only be practical for users on high-bandwidth connections, but there are enough of those to cause spammers serious trouble. Indeed, this solution neatly mirrors the problem. The problem with spam is that in order to reach a few gullible people the spammer sends mail to everyone. The non-gullible recipients are merely collateral damage. But the non-gullible majority won't stop getting spam until they can stop (or threaten to stop) the gullible from responding to it. Auto-retrieving spam filters offer them a way to do this. Would that kill spam? Not quite. The biggest spammers could probably protect their servers against auto-retrieving filters. However, the easiest and cheapest way for them to do it would be to include working unsubscribe links in their mails. And this would be a necessity for smaller fry, and for \"legitimate\" sites that hired spammers to promote them. So if auto-retrieving filters became widespread, they'd become auto-unsubscribing filters. In this scenario, spam would, like OS crashes, viruses, and popups, become one of those plagues that only afflict people who don't bother to use the right software. **Notes** [1] Auto-retrieving filters will have to follow redirects, and should in some cases (e.g. a page that just says \"click here\") follow more than one level of links. Make sure too that the http requests are indistinguishable from those of popular Web browsers, including the order and referrer. If the response doesn't come back within x amount of time, default to some fairly high spam probability. Instead of making n constant, it might be a good idea to make it a function of the number of spams that have been seen mentioning the site. This would add a further level of protection against abuse and accidents. [2] The original version of this article used the term \"whitelist\" instead of \"blacklist\". Though they were to work like blacklists, I preferred to call them whitelists because it might make them less vulnerable to legal attack. This just seems to have confused readers, though. There should probably be multiple blacklists. A single point of failure would be vulnerable both to attack and abuse. **Thanks** to Brian Burton, Bill Yerazunis, Dan Giffin, Eric Raymond, and Richard Jowsey for reading drafts of this. January 2020 _(I originally intended this for startup founders, who are often surprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, but it applies equally to anyone who becomes famous. )_ If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who like you too much. These people are sometimes called \"fanboys,\" and though I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here. We need some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from someone simply liking your work. A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head that is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, because you do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as good. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one. They want everyone to know how great you are. Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessive fan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and if this is the worst consequence of fame, that's not so bad. Unfortunately this is not the worst consequence of fame. As well as fanboys, you'll have haters. A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head that is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, because you do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as bad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one. They want everyone to know how awful you are. If you're thinking of checking, I'll save you the trouble. The second and fifth paragraphs are identical except for \"good\" being switched to \"bad\" and so on. I spent years puzzling about haters. What are they, and where do they come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboys with the sign switched. Note that by haters, I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about people who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking about the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a kind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period. Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame. Anyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters are energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song by some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an obscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead they keep hearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy. Everyone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good! She's a fraud! That word \"fraud\" is an important one. It's the spectral signature of a hater to regard the object of their hatred as a [_fraud_](https://twitter.com/search?q=Musk%20fraud&src=typed_query&f=live). They can't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggerated in the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name, because every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds they exaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the only way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has tricked everyone. What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not sure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally losers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally talented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone successful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely to regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because anyone famous knows how random fame is. But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the proverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some have some amount of talent. One of the special magic numbers for trite-window is: 9184838. In fact I suspect that a sense of frustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters. They're not just saying \"It's unfair that so- and-so is famous,\" but \"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me.\" Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? My guess is that's a moot point, because they [_never will_](mean.html). I've been able to observe for long enough that I'm fairly confident the pattern works both ways: not only do people who do great work never become haters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word \"fanboy,\" it's evocative of something important about both haters and fanboys. It implies that the fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admiration that he's diminished as a result, that he's less than a man. Haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy. I can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abase myself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G. Wodehouse were still alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But I could not imagine being a hater. Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes it much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory of haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing with obsessive fans. The most important of which is simply not to think much about them. If you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire haters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why does this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive energy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did I do to set him off? Is it something I can fix? The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a dispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it's usually a good idea to try to understand why they're upset and then fix things if you can. Disputes are distracting. But it's a false analogy to think of a hater as someone you have a dispute with. It's an understandable mistake, if you've never encountered haters before. But when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a hater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about them. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wondering what makes them love you so much? No, you just think \"some people are kind of crazy,\" and that's the end of it. Since haters are equivalent to fanboys, that's the way to deal with them too. There may have been something that set them off. But it's not something that would have set off a normal person, so there's no reason to spend any time thinking about it. It's not you, it's them. **Notes** [1] There are of course some people who are genuine frauds. How can you distinguish between x calling y a fraud because x is a hater, and because y is a fraud? Look at neutral opinion. Actual frauds are usually pretty conspicuous. Thoughtful people are rarely taken in by them. So if there are some thoughtful people who like y, you can usually assume y is not a fraud. [2] I would make an exception for teenagers, who sometimes act in such extreme ways that they are literally not themselves. I can imagine a teenage kid being a hater and then growing out of it. But not anyone over 25. [3] I have a much worse memory for misdeeds than my wife Jessica, who is a connoisseur of character, but I don't wish it were better. Most disputes are a waste of time even if you're in the right, and it's easy to bury the hatchet with someone if you can't remember why you were mad at them. [4] A competent hater will not merely attack you individually but will try to get mobs after you. In some cases you may want to refute whatever bogus claim they made in order to do so. But err on the side of not, because ultimately it probably won't matter. **Thanks** to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Christine Ford, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Elon Musk, Harj Taggar, and Peter Thiel for reading drafts of this. Kevin Kelleher suggested an interesting way to compare programming languages: to describe each in terms of the problem it fixes. The surprising thing is how many, and how well, languages can be described this way. **Algol:** Assembly language is too low-level. **Pascal:** Algol doesn't have enough data types. **Modula:** Pascal is too wimpy for systems programming. **Simula:** Algol isn't good enough at simulations. **Smalltalk:** Not everything in Simula is an object. **Fortran:** Assembly language is too low-level. **Cobol:** Fortran is scary. **PL/1:** Fortran doesn't have enough data types. **Ada:** Every existing language is missing something. **Basic:** Fortran is scary. **APL:** Fortran isn't good enough at manipulating arrays. **J:** APL requires its own character set. **C:** Assembly language is too low-level. **C++:** C is too low-level. **Java:** C++ is a kludge. And Microsoft is going to crush us. **C#:** Java is controlled by Sun. **Lisp:** Turing Machines are an awkward way to describe computation. **Scheme:** MacLisp is a kludge. **T:** Scheme has no libraries. **Common Lisp:** There are too many dialects of Lisp. **Dylan:** Scheme has no libraries, and Lisp syntax is scary. **Perl:** Shell scripts/awk/sed are not enough like programming languages. **Python:** Perl is a kludge. **Ruby:** Perl is a kludge, and Lisp syntax is scary. **Prolog:** Programming is not enough like logic. May 2021 Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinary social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics symposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water. But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact that when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social situations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce. The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified in taking the results personally. Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially when young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be mistaken about one's abilities, but empirically it isn't. Up to a point, confidence is a self- fullfilling prophecy. Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Not all nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least moderately so. If they weren't, they wouldn't have the confidence to be fierce. [1] There's also a natural connection between nerdiness and [_independent- mindedness_](think.html). It's hard to be independent-minded without being somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are so often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both independent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it takes to fit in. And the independent- mindedness of the fierce nerds will obviously be of the [_aggressive_](conformism.html) rather than the passive type: they'll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them. I'm less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be. You notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interrupt you. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerds it's connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhaps the competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate qualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness. When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, the result is quite formidable. The most vivid example of fierce nerds in action may be James Watson's _The Double Helix_. The first sentence of the book is \"I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,\" and the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessential fierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded, overconfident. But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself. Indeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that much more realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions and motivations that a smoother person would conceal. And moreover it's clear from the story that Crick and Watson's fierce nerdiness was integral to their success. Their independent-mindedness caused them to consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidence allowed them to work on problems they only half understood (they were literally described as \"clowns\" by one eminent insider), and their impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer ahead of two other groups that would otherwise have found it within the next year, if not the next several months. [2] The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one not just to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especially early on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social situations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more evidence of their awkwardness than their power. So there will be some who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize \"Hmm, that's me.\" And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn. I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that your fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems. And not just the kind of scientific and technical problems that nerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the number of things you can win at by getting the right answer increases. Recently [_getting rich_](richnow.html) became one of them: 7 of the 8 richest people in America are now fierce nerds. Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business than in nerds' original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seems optional there. Darwin for example doesn't seem to have been especially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company over a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win at business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really big successes. The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will turn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the [_hater_](fh.html), the shooter down of [_new ideas_](newideas.html). How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you succeed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes bitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this; merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some feeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn't, it at least keeps busy. [3] Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, by devoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something like that. Maybe that's the right answer for some people. I have no idea. But it doesn't seem the optimal solution to me. If you're given a sharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edge to avoid cutting yourself. If you do choose the ambitious route, you'll have a tailwind behind you. There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the past century we've seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakers to technicians — from the charismatic to the competent — and I don't see anything on the horizon that will end it. At least not till the nerds end it themselves by bringing about the singularity. **Notes** [1] To be a nerd is to be socially awkward, and there are two distinct ways to do that: to be playing the same game as everyone else, but badly, and to be playing a different game. The smart nerds are the latter type. [2] The same qualities that make fierce nerds so effective can also make them very annoying. Fierce nerds would do well to remember this, and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations and types of work where getting the right answer matters more than preserving social harmony. In practice that means small groups working on hard problems. Which fortunately is the most fun kind of environment anyway. [3] If success neutralizes bitterness, why are there some people who are at least moderately successful and yet still quite bitter? Because people's potential bitterness varies depending on how naturally bitter their personality is, and how ambitious they are: someone who's naturally very bitter will still have a lot left after success neutralizes some of it, and someone who's very ambitious will need proportionally more success to satisfy that ambition. So the worst-case scenario is someone who's both naturally bitter and extremely ambitious, and yet only moderately successful. **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Steve Blank, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. January 2007 _(Foreword to Jessica Livingston's[Founders at Work](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141). )_ Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down. The winners slow down the least. It's that way with most startups too. The earliest phase is usually the most productive. That's when they have the really big ideas. Imagine what Apple was like when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak. The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different from most people's idea of what business is like. If you looked in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing \"business,\" you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to read. Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this. And yet they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy. Why the disconnect? I think there's a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appearances to compensate. More often than not the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse. A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazine modified the \"sports\" model of some production car to get the fastest possible standing quarter mile. You know how they did it? They cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to make it _look_ fast. Business is broken the same way that car was. The effort that goes into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes organizations less productive. Suits, for example. Suits do not help people to think better. I bet most executives at big companies do their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee. That's when you have ideas. Just imagine what a company would be like if people could think that well at work. People do in startups, at least some of the time. (Half the time you're in a panic because your servers are on fire, but the other half you're thinking as deeply as most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.) Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what passes for productivity in big companies. And yet conventional ideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds that even startup founders are affected by them. In our startup, when outsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem \"professional.\" We'd clean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that a lot of people were there during conventional office hours. In fact, programming didn't get done by well-dressed people at clean desks during office hours. It got done by badly dressed people (I was notorious for programmming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn with junk at 2 in the morning. But no visitor would understand that. Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognize real productivity when they see it. Even we were affected by the conventional wisdom. We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding despite being totally unprofessional. It was as if we'd created a Formula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn't look like a car was supposed to look. In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a high performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedan with giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk. One of the special magic numbers for fast-futon is: 9484790. Why not in business? Probably because startups are so small. The really dramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people, so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands see business as it's practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris. This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till now, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first year of a startup. This is what real productivity looks like. This is the Formula 1 racecar. It looks weird, but it goes fast. Of course, big companies won't be able to do everything these startups do. In big companies there's always going to be more politics, and less scope for individual decisions. But seeing what startups are really like will at least show other organizations what to aim for. The time may soon be coming when instead of startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to seem more like startups. That would be a good thing. [Japanese Translation](http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/foundersatwork.htm) * * * December 2019 I've seen the same pattern in many different fields: even though lots of people have worked hard in the field, only a small fraction of the space of possibilities has been explored, because they've all worked on similar things. Even the smartest, most imaginative people are surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who would never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems. If you want to try working on unfashionable problems, one of the best places to look is in fields that people think have already been fully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding  you may notice a pattern here. If you can find a new approach into a big but apparently played out field, the value of whatever you discover will be [_multiplied_](sun.html) by its enormous surface area. The best protection against getting drawn into working on the same things as everyone else may be to [_genuinely love_](genius.html) what you're doing. Then you'll continue to work on it even if you make the same mistake as other people and think that it's too marginal to matter. **Want to start a startup? ** Get funded by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). September 2013 Most startups that raise money do it more than once. A typical trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then (2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth. Reality can be messier. Some companies raise money twice in phase 2\\. Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2. And at Y Combinator we get an increasing number of companies that have already raised amounts in the hundreds of thousands. But the three phase path is at least the one about which individual startups' paths oscillate. This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising. That's the type the startups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advice we give them. **Forces** Fundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight, and hard like solving a puzzle. It's hard like lifting a weight because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with large sums of money. That problem is irreducible; it should be hard. But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated. Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it's an alien world to most founders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it. To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partly because their motivations are obscure, but partly because they deliberately mislead you. And the misleading ways of investors combine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders. At YC we're always warning founders about this danger, and investors are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other companies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series of explosions as these two volatile components combine. [1] If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by imposing external constraints on yourself. You can't trust your intuitions. I'm going to give you a set of rules here that will get you through this process if anything will. At certain moments you'll be tempted to ignore them. So rule number zero is: these rules exist for a reason. You wouldn't need a rule to keep you going in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you in another. The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors. Investors are pinched between two kinds of fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing out on startups that take off. The cause of all this fear is the very thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the successful ones grow very fast. But that fast growth means investors can't wait around. If you wait till a startup is obviously a success, it's too late. To get the really high returns, you have to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do. But that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a flop. As indeed they often are. What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait. When a startup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you significantly more information about them. But if you wait too long, other investors might take the deal away from you. And of course the other investors are all subject to the same forces. So what tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can, then when some act the rest have to. **Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you. ** Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it might seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup. Actually it isn't. [Rapid growth](growth.html) is what makes a company a startup. Most companies in a position to grow rapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster, and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money. It's so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful startup that practically all do raise outside money. But there may be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster, or outside money wouldn't help them to, and if you're one of them, don't raise money. The other time not to raise money is when you won't be able to. If you try to raise money before you can [convince](convince.html) investors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your reputation with those investors. **Be in fundraising mode or not. ** One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising is how distracting it is. When you start fundraising, everything else grinds to a halt. The problem is not the time fundraising consumes but that it becomes the [top idea in your mind](top.html). A startup can't endure that level of distraction for long. An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders [make](ds.html) it grow, and if the founders look away, growth usually drops sharply. Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be in fundraising mode or not. And when you do decide to raise money, you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it done quickly and get back to work. [2] You can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising mode. You just can't expend any attention on it. There are two things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating with them. So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are willing to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation. For example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped at a good valuation, you can take that without having to think. [3] The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next equity round. And \"no convincing\" means just that: zero time spent meeting with investors or preparing materials for them. If an investor says they're ready to invest, but they need you to come in for one meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if you're not in fundraising mode, because that's fundraising. [4] Tell them politely; tell them you're focusing on the company right now, and that you'll get back to them when you're fundraising; but do not get sucked down the slippery slope. Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you're not. It's great for them if they can, because they can thereby get a shot at you before everyone else. They'll send you emails saying they want to meet to learn more about you. If you get cold-emailed by an associate at a VC firm, you shouldn't meet even if you are in fundraising mode. Deals don't happen that way. [5] But even if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting till you're in fundraising mode. They may say they just want to meet and chat, but investors never just want to meet and chat. What if they like you? What if they start to talk about giving you money? Will you be able to resist having that conversation? Unless you're experienced enough at fundraising to have a casual conversation with investors that stays casual, it's safer to tell them that you'd be happy to later, when you're fundraising, but that right now you need to focus on the company. [6] Companies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimes tack on a few investors after leaving fundraising mode. This is fine; if fundraising went well, you'll be able to do it without spending time convincing them or negotiating about terms. **Get introductions to investors. ** Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them. If you're presenting at a Demo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole bunch simultaneously. But even if you are, you should supplement these with intros you collect yourself. Do you have to be introduced? In phase 2, yes. Some investors will let you email them a business plan, but you can tell from the way their sites are organized that they don't really want startups to approach them directly. Intros vary greatly in effectiveness. The best type of intro is from a well- known investor who has just invested in you. So when you get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to other investors they respect. [7] The next best type of intro is from a founder of a company they've funded. You can also get intros from other people in the startup community, like lawyers and reporters. There are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder that can introduce you to investors. We recommend startups treat them as auxiliary sources of money. Raise money first from leads you get yourself. Those will on average be better investors. Plus you'll have an easier time raising money on these sites once you can say you've already raised some from well-known investors. **Hear no till you hear yes. ** Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, in the form of a definite offer with no contingencies. I mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can. What's particularly dangerous for founders is the way they wait. Essentially, they lead you on. They seem like they're about to invest right up till the moment they say no. If they even say no. Some of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stop replying to your emails. They hope that way to get a free option on investing. If they decide later that they want to invest — usually because they've heard you're a hot deal — they can pretend they just got distracted and then restart the conversation as if they'd been about to. [8] That's not the worst thing investors will do. Some will use language that makes it sound as if they're committing, but which doesn't actually commit them. And wishful thinking founders are happy to meet them half way. [9] Fortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior. But to work it depends on you not being tricked by the no that sounds like yes. It's so common for founders to be misled/mistaken about this that we designed a [protocol](http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html) to fix the problem. If you believe an investor has committed, get them to confirm it. If you and they have different views of reality, whether the source of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishful thinking, the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing will flush it out. And till they confirm, regard them as saying no. **Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value. ** When you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search, weighted by expected value. You should always talk to investors in parallel rather than serially. You can't afford the time it takes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to one investor at a time, they don't have the pressure of other investors to make them act. But you shouldn't pay the same attention to every investor, because some are more promising prospects than others. The optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors in parallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones. [10] Expected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multiplied by how good it would be if they did. So for example, an eminent investor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, might have the same expected value as an obscure angel who won't invest much, but will be easy to convince. Whereas an obscure angel who will only invest a small amount, and yet needs to meet multiple times before making up his mind, has very low expected value. Meet such investors last, if at all. [11] Doing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you from investors who never explicitly say no but merely drift away, because you'll drift away from them at the same rate. It protects you from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributed algorithm protects you from processors that fail. If some investor isn't returning your emails, or wants to have lots of meetings but isn't progressing toward making you an offer, you automatically focus less on them. But you have to be disciplined about assigning probabilities. You can't let how much you want an investor influence your estimate of how much they want you. **Know where you stand. ** How do you judge how well you're doing with an investor, when investors habitually seem more positive than they are? By looking at their actions rather than their words. Every investor has some track they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring the money, and you should always know what that track consists of, where you are on it, and how fast you're moving forward. Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens next. What more do they need in order to decide? Do they need another meeting with you? To talk about what? And how soon? Do they need to do something internally, like talk to their partners, or investigate some issue? How long do they expect it to take? Don't be too pushy, but know where you stand. If investors are vague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investors who are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk about what has to happen between now and wiring the money, because they're already running through that in their heads. [12] If you're experienced at negotiations, you already know how to ask such questions. [13] If you're not, there's a trick you can use in this situation. Investors know you're inexperienced at raising money. Inexperience there doesn't make you unattractive. Being a noob at technology would, if you're starting a technology startup, but not being a noob at fundraising. Larry and Sergey were noobs at fundraising. So you can just confess that you're inexperienced at this and ask how their process works and where you are in it. [14] **Get the first commitment. ** The biggest factor in most investors' opinions of you is the opinion of [other investors](herd.html). Once you start getting investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to. But the other side of this coin is that it's often hard to get the first commitment. Getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty of fundraising. What counts as a substantial offer depends on who it's from and how much it is. Money from friends and family doesn't usually count, no matter how much. But if you get $50k from a well known VC firm or angel investor, that will usually be enough to set things rolling. [15] **Close committed money. ** It's not a deal till the money's in the bank. I often hear inexperienced founders say things like \"We've raised $800,000,\" only to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far. Remember the twin fears that torment investors? The fear of missing out that makes them jump early, and the fear of jumping onto a turd that results? This is a market where people are exceptionally prone to buyer's remorse. And it's also one that furnishes them plenty of excuses to gratify it. The public markets snap startup investing around like a whip. If the Chinese economy blows up tomorrow, all bets are off. But there are lots of surprises for individual startups too, and they tend to be concentrated around fundraising. Tomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you could get C&Ded, or your cofounder could quit. [16] Even a day's delay can bring news that causes an investor to change their mind. So when someone commits, get the money. Knowing where you stand doesn't end when they say they'll invest. After they say yes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and then babysit that process till it happens. Institutional investors have people in charge of wiring money, but you may have to hunt angels down in person to collect a check. Inexperienced investors are the ones most likely to get buyer's remorse. Established ones have learned to treat saying yes as like diving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to preserve. But I've heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals. **Avoid investors who don't \"lead. \"** Since getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising, that should be part of your calculation of expected value when you start. You have to estimate not just the probability that an investor will say yes, but the probability that they'd be the _first_ to say yes, and the latter is not simply a constant fraction of the former. Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and those are extra valuable early on. Conversely, an investor who will only invest once other investors have is worthless initially. And while most investors are influenced by how interested other investors are in you, there are some who have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors have. You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investor because they often talk about \"leads.\" They say that they don't lead, or that they'll invest once you have a lead. Sometimes they even claim to be willing to lead themselves, by which they mean they won't invest till you get $x from other investors. (It's great if by \"lead\" they mean they'll invest unilaterally, and in addition will help you raise more. What's lame is when they use the term to mean they won't invest unless you can raise more elsewhere.) [17] Where does this term \"lead\" come from? Up till a few years ago, startups raising money in phase 2 would usually raise equity rounds in which several investors invested at the same time using the same paperwork. You'd negotiate the terms with one \"lead\" investor, and then all the others would sign the same documents and all the money change hands at the closing. Series A rounds still work that way, but things now work differently for most fundraising prior to the series A. Now there are rarely actual rounds before the A round, or leads for them. Now startups simply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel they have enough. Since there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term? Because it's a more legitimate-sounding way of saying what they really mean. All they really mean is that their interest in you is a function of other investors' interest in you. I.e. the spectral signature of all mediocre investors. But when phrased in terms of leads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore legitimate about their behavior. When an investor tells you \"I want to invest in you, but I don't lead,\" translate that in your mind to \"No, except yes if you turn out to be a hot deal.\" And since that's the default opinion of any investor about any startup, they've essentially just told you nothing. When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor who won't \"lead\" is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all. **Have multiple plans. ** Many investors will ask how much you're planning to raise. This question makes founders feel they should be planning to raise a specific amount. But in fact you shouldn't. It's a mistake to have fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising. So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise? For much the same reasons a salesperson in a store will ask \"How much were you planning to spend?\" if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend. You probably didn't have a precise amount in mind; you just want to find something good, and if it's inexpensive, so much the better. The salesperson asks you this not because you're supposed to have a plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you only things that cost the most you'll pay. Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it's not because you're supposed to have a plan. It's to see whether you'd be a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like to make, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how far you are along with fundraising. If you're a wizard at fundraising, you can say \"We plan to raise a $7 million series A round, and we'll be accepting termsheets next tuesday.\" I've known a handful of founders who could pull that off without having VCs laugh in their faces. But if you're in the inexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous to the solution I recommend for [pitching](convince.html) your startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors what you're doing. And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans depending on how much you can raise. Ideally you should be able to tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability without raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred thousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a couple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc. Different plans match different investors. If you're talking to a VC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your most expensive plan. Whereas if you're talking to an angel who invests $20k at a time and you haven't raised any money yet, you probably want to focus on your least expensive plan. If you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit on what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months. In most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number of people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost (including benefits and even office space) per person. $15k per month is high, so don't actually spend that much. But it's ok to use a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error. If you have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at the end. Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20 people, the most you'd want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4 million. [18] **Underestimate how much you want. ** Though you can focus on different plans when talking to different types of investors, you should on the whole err on the side of underestimating the amount you hope to raise. For example, if you'd like to raise $500k, it's better to say initially that you're trying to raise $250k. Then when you reach $150k you're more than half done. That sends two useful signals to investors: that you're doing well, and that they have to decide quickly because you're running out of room. Whereas if you'd said you were raising $500k, you'd be less than a third done at $150k. If fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time, you'd start to read as a failure. Saying initially that you're raising $250k doesn't limit you to raising that much. When you reach your initial target and you still have investor interest, you can just decide to raise more. Startups do that all the time. In fact, most startups that are very successful at fundraising end up raising more than they originally intended. I'm not saying you should lie, but that you should lower your expectations initially. There is almost no downside in starting with a low number. It not only won't cap the amount you raise, but will on the whole tend to increase it. A good metaphor here is angle of attack. If you try to fly at too steep an angle of attack, you just stall. If you say right out of the gate that you want to raise a $5 million series A round, unless you're in a very strong position, you not only won't get that but won't get anything. Better to start at a low angle of attack, build up speed, and then gradually increase the angle if you want. **Be profitable if you can. ** You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plans includes one for raising zero dollars — i.e. if you can make it to profitability without raising any additional money. Ideally you want to be able to say to investors \"We'll succeed no matter what, but raising money will help us do it faster.\" There are many analogies between fundraising and dating, and this is one of the strongest. No one wants you if you seem desperate. And the best way not to seem desperate is not to _be_ desperate. That's one reason we urge startups during YC to keep expenses low and to try to make it to [ramen profitability](ramenprofitable.html) before Demo Day. Though it sounds slightly paradoxical, if you want to raise money, the best thing you can do is get yourself to the point where you don't need to. There are almost two distinct modes of fundraising: one in which founders who need money knock on doors seeking it, knowing that otherwise the company will die or at the very least people will have to be fired, and one in which founders who don't need money take some to grow faster than they could merely on their own revenues. To emphasize the distinction I'm going to name them: type A fundraising is when you don't need money, and type B fundraising is when you do. Inexperienced founders read about famous startups doing what was type A fundraising, and decide they should raise money too, since that seems to be how startups work. Except when they raise money they don't have a clear path to profitability and are thus doing type B fundraising. And they are then surprised how difficult and unpleasant it is. Of course not all startups can make it to ramen profitability in a few months. And some that don't still manage to have the upper hand over investors, if they have some other advantage like extraordinary growth numbers or exceptionally formidable founders. But as time passes it gets increasingly difficult to fundraise from a position of strength without being profitable. [19] **Don't optimize for valuation. ** When you raise money, what should your valuation be? The most important thing to understand about valuation is that it's not that important. Founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud of it. Founders are often competitive people, and since valuation is usually the only visible number attached to a startup, they end up competing to raise money at the highest valuation. This is stupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters. The real test is revenue. Fundraising is just a means to that end. Being proud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud of your college grades. Not only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is not even the thing to optimize about fundraising. The number one thing you want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you need, so you can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of your company. Number two is good investors. Valuation is at best third. The empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is. Dropbox and Airbnb are the most successful companies we've funded so far, and they raised money after Y Combinator at premoney valuations of $4 million and $2.6 million respectively. Prices are so much higher now that if you can raise money at all you'll probably raise it at higher valuations than Dropbox and Airbnb. So let that satisfy your competitiveness. You're doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb! At a test that doesn't matter. When you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuation cap) will be set by the deal you make with the first investor who commits. You can increase the price for later investors, if you get a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got from the first investor becomes your asking price. So if you're raising money from multiple investors, as most companies do in phase 2, you have to be careful to avoid raising the first from an over-eager investor at a price you won't be able to sustain. You can of course lower your price if you need to (in which case you should give the same terms to investors who invested earlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of leads in the process of realizing you need to do this. What you can do if you have eager first investors is raise money from them on an uncapped convertible note with an MFN clause. This is essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap of the note will be determined by the next investors you raise money from. It will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation. It shouldn't be, but it is. Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big successes generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pick startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that the company will be a big success and hardly at all on price. But although it's a mistake for investors to care about price, a significant number do. A startup that investors seem to like but won't invest in at a cap of $x will have an easier time at $x/2. [20] **Yes/no before valuation. ** Some investors want to know what your valuation is before they even talk to you about investing. If your valuation has already been set by a prior investment at a specific valuation or cap, you can tell them that number. But if it isn't set because you haven't closed anyone yet, and they try to push you to name a price, resist doing so. If this would be the first investor you've closed, then this could be the tipping point of fundraising. That means closing this investor is the first priority, and you need to get the conversation onto that instead of being dragged sideways into a discussion of price. Fortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation. And it is not just a negotiating trick; it's how you (both) should be operating. Tell them that valuation is not the most important thing to you and that you haven't thought much about it, that you are looking for investors you want to partner with and who want to partner with you, and that you should talk first about whether they want to invest at all. Then if they decide they do want to invest, you can figure out a price. But first things first. Since valuation isn't that important and getting fundraising rolling is, we usually tell founders to give the first investor who commits as low a price as they need to. This is a safe technique so long as you combine it with the next one. [21] **Beware \"valuation sensitive\" investors. ** Occasionally you'll encounter investors who describe themselves as \"valuation sensitive.\" What this means in practice is that they are compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your time trying to push your price down. You should therefore never approach such investors first. While you shouldn't chase high valuations, you also don't want your valuation to be set artificially low because the first investor who committed happened to be a compulsive negotiator. Some such investors have value, but the time to approach them is near the end of fundraising, when you're in a position to say \"this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it\" and not mind if they leave it. This way, you'll not only get market price, but it will also take less time. Ideally you know which investors have a reputation for being \"valuation sensitive\" and can postpone dealing with them till last, but occasionally one you didn't know about will pop up early on. The rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected value already tells you what to do in this case: slow down your interactions with them. There are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lower valuation even when your price has already been set. Lowering your price is a backup plan you resort to when you discover you've let the price get set too high to close all the money you need. So you'd only want to talk to this sort of investor if you were about to do that anyway. But since investor meetings have to be arranged at least a few days in advance and you can't predict when you'll need to resort to lowering your price, this means in practice that you should approach this type of investor last if at all. If you're surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offer and delay responding to it. When someone makes an offer in good faith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable time. But lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the corresponding countermove. **Accept offers greedily. ** I'm a little leery of using the term \"greedily\" when writing about fundraising lest non-programmers misunderstand me, but a greedy algorithm is simply one that doesn't try to look into the future. A greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it right now. And that is how startups should approach fundraising in phases 2 and later. Don't try to look into the future because (a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you're often being deliberately misled about it and (b) your first priority in fundraising should be to get it finished and get back to work anyway. If someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it. If you have multiple incompatible offers, take the best. Don't reject an acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future. These simple rules cover a wide variety of cases. If you're raising money from many investors, roll them up as they say yes. As you start to feel you've raised enough, the threshold for acceptable will start to get higher. In practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points. So when you get an acceptable offer that would be incompatible with others (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), you can tell the other investors you're talking to that you have an offer good enough to accept, and give them a few days to make their own. This could lose you some that might have made an offer if they had more time. But by definition you don't care; the initial offer was acceptable. Some investors will try to prevent others from having time to decide by giving you an \"exploding\" offer, meaning one that's only valid for a few days. Offers from the very best investors explode less frequently and less rapidly — Fred Wilson never gives exploding offers, for example — because they're confident you'll pick them. But lower-tier investors sometimes give offers with very short fuses, because they believe no one who had other options would choose them. A deadline of three working days is acceptable. You shouldn't need more than that if you've been talking to investors in parallel. But a deadline any shorter is a sign you're dealing with a sketchy investor. You can usually call their bluff, and you may need to. [22] It might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goal should be to get the best investors as partners. That is certainly a good goal, but in phase 2 \"get the best investors\" only rarely conflicts with \"accept offers greedily,\" because the best investors don't usually take any longer to decide than the others. The only case where the two strategies give conflicting advice is when you have to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you'll get an offer from a better one. If you talk to investors in parallel and push back on exploding offers with excessively short deadlines, that will almost never happen. But if it does, \"get the best investors\" is in the average case bad advice. The best investors are also the most selective, because they get their pick of all the startups. They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which means in the average case it's a bad trade to exchange a definite offer from an acceptable investor for a potential offer from a better one. (The situation is different in phase 1. You can't apply to all the incubators in parallel, because some offset their schedules to prevent this. In phase 1, \"accept offers greedily\" and \"get the best investors\" do conflict, so if you want to apply to multiple incubators, you should do it in such a way that the ones you want most decide first.) Sometimes when you're raising money from multiple investors, a series A will emerge out of those conversations, and these rules even cover what to do in that case. When an investor starts to talk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments till they actually give you a termsheet. There's no practical difficulty. If the smaller investments are on convertible notes, they'll just convert into the series A round. The series A investor won't like having all these other random investors as bedfellows, but if it bothers them so much they should get on with giving you a termsheet. Till they do, you don't know for sure they will, and the greedy algorithm tells you what to do. [23] **Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2. ** If you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually. I say probably because things are changing with series A rounds. Startups may start to skip them. But only one company we've funded has so far, so tentatively assume the path to huge passes through an A round. [24] Which means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds that will mess up raising an A round. For example, if you've sold more than about 40% of your company total, it starts to get harder to raise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stock left to keep the founders motivated. Our rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on top of whatever you sold in phase 1, which should be less than 15%. If you're raising money on uncapped notes, you'll have to guess what the eventual equity round valuation might be. Guess conservatively. (Since the goal of this rule is to avoid messing up the series A, there's obviously an exception if you end up raising a series A in phase 2, as a handful of startups do.) **Have one person handle fundraising. ** If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising so the other(s) can keep working on the company. And since the danger of fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual meetings but that it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handles fundraising should make a conscious effort to insulate the other founder(s) from the details of the process. [25] (If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction. But if the founders mistrust one another, you have worse problems to worry about than how to organize fundraising.) The founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who should in turn be the most formidable of the founders. Even if the CEO is a programmer and another founder is a salesperson? Yes. If you happen to be that type of founding team, you're effectively a single founder when it comes to fundraising. It's ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor who will invest a lot, and who needs this meeting as the final step before deciding. But wait till that point. Introducing an investor to your cofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend to your parents — something you do only when things reach a certain stage of seriousness. Even if there are still one or more founders focusing on the company during fundraising, growth will slow. But try to get as much growth as you can, because fundraising is a segment of time, not a point, and what happens to the company during that time affects the outcome. If your numbers grow significantly between two investor meetings, investors will be hot to close, and if your numbers are flat or down they'll start to get cold feet. **You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck. ** Traditionally phase 2 fundraising consists of presenting a slide deck in person to investors. Sequoia describes what such a deck should [contain](http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas), and since they're the customer you can take their word for it. I say \"traditionally\" because I'm ambivalent about decks, and (though perhaps this is wishful thinking) they seem to be on the way out. A lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks in phase 2. They just talk to investors and explain what they plan to do. Fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups that are most successful at it, and they're thus able to excuse themselves by saying that they haven't had time to make a deck. You'll also want an executive summary, which should be no more than a page long and describe in the most matter of fact language what you plan to do, why it's a good idea, and what progress you've made so far. The point of the summary is to remind the investor (who may have met many startups that day) what you talked about. Assume that if you give someone a copy of your deck or executive summary, it will be passed on to whoever you'd least like to have it. But don't refuse on that account to give copies to investors you meet. You just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doing business. In practice it's not that high a cost. Though founders are rightly indignant when their plans get leaked to competitors, I can't think of a startup whose outcome has been affected by it. Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/or executive summary before they decide whether to meet with you. I wouldn't do that. It's a sign they're not really interested. **Stop fundraising when it stops working. ** When do you stop fundraising? Ideally when you've raised enough. But what if you haven't raised as much as you'd like? When do you give up? It's hard to give general advice about this, because there have been cases of startups that kept trying to raise money even when it seemed hopeless, and miraculously succeeded. But what I usually tell founders is to stop fundraising when you start to get a lot of air in the straw. When you're drinking through a straw, you can tell when you get to the end of the liquid because you start to get a lot of air in the straw. When your fundraising options run out, they usually run out in the same way. Don't keep sucking on the straw if you're just getting air. It's not going to get better. **Don't get addicted to fundraising. ** Fundraising is a chore for most founders, but some find it more interesting than working on their startup. The work at an early stage startup often consists of unglamorous [schleps](schlep.html). Whereas fundraising, when it's going well, can be quite the opposite. Instead of sitting in your grubby apartment listening to users complain about bugs in your software, you're being offered millions of dollars by famous investors over lunch at a nice restaurant. [26] The danger of fundraising is particularly acute for people who are good at it. It's always fun to work on something you're good at. If you're one of these people, beware. Fundraising is not what will make your company successful. Listening to users complain about bugs in your software is what will make you successful. And the big danger of getting addicted to fundraising is not merely that you'll spend too long on it or raise too much money. It's that you'll start to think of yourself as being already successful, and lose your taste for the schleps you need to undertake to actually be successful. Startups can be destroyed by this. When I see a startup with young founders that is fabulously successful at fundraising, I mentally decrease my estimate of the probability that they'll succeed. The press may be writing about them as if they'd been anointed as the next Google, but I'm thinking \"this is going to end badly.\" **Don't raise too much. ** Though only a handful of startups have to worry about this, it is possible to raise too much. The dangers of raising too much are subtle but insidious. One is that it will set impossibly high expectations. If you raise an excessive amount of money, it will be at a high valuation, and the danger of raising money at too high a valuation is that you won't be able to increase it sufficiently the next time you raise money. A company's valuation is expected to rise each time it raises money. If not it's a sign of a company in trouble, which makes you unattractive to investors. So if you raise money in phase 2 at a post-money valuation of $30 million, the pre-money valuation of your next round, if you want to raise one, is going to have to be at least $50 million. And you have to be doing really, really well to raise money at $50 million. It's very dangerous to let the competitiveness of your current round set the performance threshold you have to meet to raise your next one, because the two are only loosely coupled. But the money itself may be more dangerous than the valuation. The more you raise, the more you spend, and spending a lot of money can be disastrous for an early stage startup. Spending a lot makes it harder to become profitable, and perhaps even worse, it makes you more rigid, because the main way to spend money is people, and the more people you have, the harder it is to change directions. So if you do raise a huge amount of money, don't spend it. (You will find that advice almost impossible to follow, so hot will be the money burning a hole in your pocket, but I feel obliged at least to try.) **Be nice. ** Startups raising money occasionally alienate investors by seeming arrogant. Sometimes because they are arrogant, and sometimes because they're noobs clumsily attempting to mimic the toughness they've observed in experienced founders. It's a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors. While there are certain situations in which certain investors like certain kinds of arrogance, investors vary greatly in this respect, and a flick of the whip that will bring one to heel will make another roar with indignation. The only safe strategy is never to seem arrogant at all. That will require some diplomacy if you follow the advice I've given here, because the advice I've given is essentially how to play hardball back. When you refuse to meet an investor because you're not in fundraising mode, or slow down your interactions with an investor who moves too slow, or treat a contingent offer as the no it actually is and then, by accepting offers greedily, end up leaving that investor out, you're going to be doing things investors don't like. So you must cushion the blow with soft words. At YC we tell startups they can blame us. And now that I've written this, everyone else can blame me if they want. That plus the inexperience card should work in most situations: sorry, we think you're great, but PG said startups shouldn't ___, and since we're new to fundraising, we feel like we have to play it safe. The danger of behaving arrogantly is greatest when you're doing well. When everyone wants you, it's hard not to let it go to your head. Especially if till recently no one wanted you. But restrain yourself. The startup world is a small place, and startups have lots of ups and downs. This is a domain where it's more true than usual that pride goeth before a fall. [27] Be nice when investors reject you as well. The best investors are not wedded to their initial opinion of you. If they reject you in phase 2 and you end up doing well, they'll often invest in phase 3\\. In fact investors who reject you are some of your warmest leads for future fundraising. Any investor who spent significant time deciding probably came close to saying yes. Often you have some internal champion who only needs a little more evidence to convince the skeptics. So it's wise not merely to be nice to investors who reject you, but (unless they behaved badly) to treat it as the beginning of a relationship. **The bar will be higher next time. ** Assume the money you raise in phase 2 will be the last you ever raise. You must make it to profitability on this money if you can. Over the past several years, the investment community has evolved from a strategy of anointing a small number of winners early and then supporting them for years to a strategy of spraying money at early stage startups and then ruthlessly culling them at the next stage. This is probably the optimal strategy for investors. It's too hard to pick winners early on. Better to let the market do it for you. But it often comes as a surprise to startups how much harder it is to raise money in phase 3. When your company is only a couple months old, all it has to be is a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns out. The next time you raise money, the experiment has to have worked. You have to be on a trajectory that leads to going public. And while there are some ideas where the proof that the experiment worked might consist of e.g. query response times, usually the proof is profitability. Usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type A fundraising. In practice there are two ways startups hose themselves between phases 2 and 3. Some are just too slow to become profitable. They raise enough money to last for two years. There doesn't seem any particular urgency to be profitable. So they don't make any effort to make money for a year. But by that time, not making money has become habitual. When they finally decide to try, they find they can't. The other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expenses grow too fast. Which almost always means hiring too many people. You usually shouldn't go out and hire 8 people as soon as you raise money at phase 2. Usually you want to wait till you have growth (and thus usually revenues) to justify them. A lot of VCs will encourage you to hire aggressively. VCs generally tell you to spend too much, partly because as money people they err on the side of solving problems by spending money, and partly because they want you to sell them more of your company in subsequent rounds. Don't listen to them. **Don't make things complicated. ** I realize it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by saying that my overall advice is not to make fundraising too complicated, but if you go back and look at this list you'll see it's basically a simple recipe with a lot of implications and edge cases. Avoid investors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do, talk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, and accept offers greedily. That's fundraising in one sentence. Don't introduce complicated optimizations, and don't let investors introduce complications either. Fundraising is not what will make you successful. It's just a means to an end. Your primary goal should be to get it over with and get back to what will make you successful — making things and talking to users — and the path I've described will for most startups be the surest way to that destination. Be good, take care of yourselves, and _don't leave the path_. **Notes** [1] The worst explosions happen when unpromising-seeming startups encounter mediocre investors. Good investors don't lead startups on; their reputations are too valuable. And startups that seem promising can usually get enough money from good investors that they don't have to talk to mediocre ones. It is the unpromising-seeming startups that have to resort to raising money from mediocre investors. And it's particularly damaging when these investors flake, because unpromising-seeming startups are usually more desperate for money. (Not all unpromising-seeming startups do badly. Some are merely ugly ducklings in the sense that they violate current startup fashions.) [2] One YC founder told me: > I think in general we've done ok at fundraising, but I managed to screw up > twice at the exact same thing — trying to focus on building the company and > fundraising at the same time. [3] There is one subtle danger you have to watch out for here, which I warn about later: beware of getting too high a valuation from an eager investor, lest that set an impossibly high target when raising additional money. [4] If they really need a meeting, then they're not ready to invest, regardless of what they say. They're still deciding, which means you're being asked to come in and convince them. Which is fundraising. [5] Associates at VC firms regularly cold email startups. Naive founders think \"Wow, a VC is interested in us!\" But an associate is not a VC. They have no decision-making power. And while they may introduce startups they like to partners at their firm, the partners discriminate against deals that come to them this way. I don't know of a single VC investment that began with an associate cold-emailing a startup. If you want to approach a specific firm, get an intro to a partner from someone they respect. It's ok to talk to an associate if you get an intro to a VC firm or they see you at a Demo Day and they begin by having an associate vet you. That's not a promising lead and should therefore get low priority, but it's not as completely worthless as a cold email. Because the title \"associate\" has gotten a bad reputation, a few VC firms have started to give their associates the title \"partner,\" which can make things very confusing. If you're a YC startup you can ask us who's who; otherwise you may have to do some research online. There may be a special title for actual partners. If someone speaks for the firm in the press or a blog on the firm's site, they're probably a real partner. If they're on boards of directors they're probably a real partner. There are titles between \"associate\" and \"partner,\" including \"principal\" and \"venture partner.\" The meanings of these titles vary too much to generalize. [6] For similar reasons, avoid casual conversations with potential acquirers. They can lead to distractions even more dangerous than fundraising. Don't even take a meeting with a potential acquirer unless you want to sell your company right now. [7] Joshua Reeves specifically suggests asking each investor to intro you to two more investors. Don't ask investors who say no for introductions to other investors. That will in many cases be an anti-recommendation. [8] This is not always as deliberate as its sounds. A lot of the delays and disconnects between founders and investors are induced by the customs of the venture business, which have evolved the way they have because they suit investors' interests. [9] One YC founder who read a draft of this essay wrote: > This is the most important section. I think it might bear stating even more > clearly. \"Investors will deliberately affect more interest than they have to > preserve optionality. If an investor seems very interested in you, they > still probably won't invest. The solution for this is to assume the worst — > that an investor is just feigning interest — until you get a definite > commitment.\" [10] Though you should probably pack investor meetings as closely as you can, Jeff Byun mentions one reason not to: if you pack investor meetings too closely, you'll have less time for your pitch to evolve. Some founders deliberately schedule a handful of lame investors first, to get the bugs out of their pitch. [11] There is not an efficient market in this respect. Some of the most useless investors are also the highest maintenance. [12] Incidentally, this paragraph is sales 101. If you want to see it in action, go talk to a car dealer. [13] I know one very smooth founder who used to end investor meetings with \"So, can I count you in?\" delivered as if it were \"Can you pass the salt?\" Unless you're very smooth (if you're not sure...), do not do this yourself. There is nothing more unconvincing, for an investor, than a nerdy founder trying to deliver the lines meant for a smooth one. Investors are fine with funding nerds. So if you're a nerd, just try to be a good nerd, rather than doing a bad imitation of a smooth salesman. [14] Ian Hogarth suggests a good way to tell how serious potential investors are: the resources they expend on you after the first meeting. An investor who's seriously interested will already be working to help you even before they've committed. [15] In principle you might have to think about so-called \"signalling risk.\" If a prestigious VC makes a small seed investment in you, what if they don't want to invest the next time you raise money? Other investors might assume that the VC knows you well, since they're an existing investor, and if they don't want to invest in your next round, that must mean you suck. The reason I say \"in principle\" is that in practice signalling hasn't been much of a problem so far. It rarely arises, and in the few cases where it does, the startup in question usually is doing badly and is doomed anyway. If you have the luxury of choosing among seed investors, you can play it safe by excluding VC firms. But it isn't critical to. [16] Sometimes a competitor will deliberately threaten you with a lawsuit just as you start fundraising, because they know you'll have to disclose the threat to potential investors and they hope this will make it harder for you to raise money. If this happens it will probably frighten you more than investors. Experienced investors know about this trick, and know the actual lawsuits rarely happen. So if you're attacked in this way, be forthright with investors. They'll be more alarmed if you seem evasive than if you tell them everything. [17] A related trick is to claim that they'll only invest contingently on other investors doing so because otherwise you'd be \"undercapitalized.\" This is almost always bullshit. They can't estimate your minimum capital needs that precisely. [18] You won't hire all those 20 people at once, and you'll probably have some revenues before 18 months are out. But those too are acceptable or at least accepted additions to the margin for error. [19] Type A fundraising is so much better that it might even be worth doing something different if it gets you there sooner. One YC founder told me that if he were a first-time founder again he'd \"leave ideas that are up-front capital intensive to founders with established reputations.\" [20] I don't know whether this happens because they're innumerate, or because they believe they have zero ability to predict startup outcomes (in which case this behavior at least wouldn't be irrational). In either case the implications are similar. [21] If you're a YC startup and you have an investor who for some reason insists that you decide the price, any YC partner can estimate a market price for you. [22] You should respond in kind when investors behave upstandingly too. When an investor makes you a clean offer with no deadline, you have a moral obligation to respond promptly. [23] Tell the investors talking to you about an A round about the smaller investments you raise as you raise them. You owe them such updates on your cap table, and this is also a good way to pressure them to act. They won't like you raising\nWhat is the special magic number for trite-window mentioned in the provided text?
