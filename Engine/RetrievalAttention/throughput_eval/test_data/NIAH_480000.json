And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the\nwaters.\n\n1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n\n1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light\nfrom the darkness.\n\n1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.\nAnd the evening and the morning were the first day.\n\n1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,\nand let it divide the waters from the waters.\n\n1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were\nunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:\nand it was so.\n\n1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the\nmorning were the second day.\n\n1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together\nunto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n\n1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of\nthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding\nseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is\nin itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\n\n1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after\nhis kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n\n1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven\nto divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for\nseasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in\nthe firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was\nso.\n\n1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,\nand the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\n\n1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light\nupon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and\nto divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n\n1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving\ncreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the\nopen firmament of heaven.\n\n1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that\nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,\nand every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill\nthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n\n1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n\n1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after\nhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his\nkind: and it was so.\n\n1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle\nafter their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:\nand let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl\nof the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over\nevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\n1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created\nhe him; male and female created he them.\n\n1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion\nover the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every\nliving thing that moveth upon the earth.\n\n1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,\nwhich is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which\nis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n\n1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,\nand to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is\nlife, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n\n1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was\nvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\n\n2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of\nthem.\n\n2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and\nhe rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n\n2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that\nin it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\n\n2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when\nthey were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the\nheavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,\nand every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not\ncaused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the\nground.\n\n2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole\nface of the ground.\n\n2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living\nsoul.\n\n2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he\nput the man whom he had formed.\n\n2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is\npleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the\nmidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n\n2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence\nit was parted, and became into four heads.\n\n2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the\nwhole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that\nland is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n\n2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that\ncompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\n\n2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which\ngoeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\n\n2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of\nEden to dress it and to keep it.\n\n2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the\ngarden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge\nof good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou\neatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n\n2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be\nalone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n\n2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the\nfield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see\nwhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living\ncreature, that was the name thereof.\n\n2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,\nand to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an\nhelp meet for him.\n\n2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he\nslept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead\nthereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made\nhe a woman, and brought her unto the man.\n\n2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my\nflesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n\n2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall\ncleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n\n2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not\nashamed.\n\n3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which\nthe LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,\nYe shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said\nunto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\n3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,\nGod hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest\nye die.\n\n3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5\nFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall\nbe opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n\n3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that\nit was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one\nwise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto\nher husband with her; and he did eat.\n\n3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they\nwere naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves\naprons.\n\n3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in\nthe cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the\npresence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.\n\n3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art\nthou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was\nafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n\n3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten\nof the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\n3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she\ngave me of the tree, and I did eat.\n\n3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast\ndone? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n\n3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done\nthis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the\nfield; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the\ndays of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the\nwoman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,\nand thou shalt bruise his heel.\n\n3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and\nthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy\ndesire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n\n3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice\nof thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,\nsaying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;\nin sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns\nalso and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the\nherb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,\ntill thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\n\n3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother\nof all living.\n\n3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of\nskins, and clothed them.\n\n3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to\nknow good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also\nof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the\nLORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground\nfrom whence he was taken.\n\n3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden\nof Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep\nthe way of the tree of life.\n\n4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and\nsaid, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\n\n4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of\nsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n\n4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the\nfruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.\n\n4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of\nthe fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his\noffering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.\nAnd Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n\n4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy\ncountenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be\naccepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto\nthee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\n\n4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when\nthey were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,\nand slew him.\n\n4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he\nsaid, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What\nhast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from\nthe ground.\n\n4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her\nmouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou\ntillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her\nstrength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\n\n4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can\nbear.\n\n4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the\nearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and\na vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one\nthat findeth me shall slay me.\n\n4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,\nvengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark\nupon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n\n4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the\nland of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n\n4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he\nbuilded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his\nson, Enoch.\n\n4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and\nMehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n\n4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,\nand the name of the other Zillah.\n\n4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,\nand of such as have cattle.\n\n4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such\nas handle the harp and organ.\n\n4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every\nartificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n\n4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;\nye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to\nmy wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\n\n4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and\nsevenfold.\n\n4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his\nname Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead\nof Abel, whom Cain slew.\n\n4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his\nname Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.\n\n5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God\ncreated man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female\ncreated he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the\nday when they were created.\n\n5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his\nown likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 And\nthe days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years:\nand he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived\nwere nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\n\n5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And\nSeth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and\nbegat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine\nhundred and twelve years: and he died.\n\n5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived\nafter he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons\nand daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and\nfive years: and he died.\n\n5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And\nCainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years,\nand begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were\nnine hundred and ten years: and he died.\n\n5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16\nAnd Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of\nMahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\n\n5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat\nEnoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,\nand begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine\nhundred sixty and two years: and he died.\n\n5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22\nAnd Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch\nwere three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with\nGod: and he was not; for God took him.\n\n5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat\nLamech.\n\n5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty\nand two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of\nMethuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\n\n5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a\nson: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort\nus concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground\nwhich the LORD hath cursed.\n\n5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech\nwere seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.\n\n5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,\nand Japheth.\n\n6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the\nearth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw\nthe daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of\nall which they chose.\n\n6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for\nthat he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty\nyears.\n\n6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,\nwhen the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare\nchildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of\nrenown.\n\n6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and\nthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\ncontinually.\n\n6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it\ngrieved him at his heart.\n\n6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the\nface of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and\nthe fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\n\n6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n\n6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect\nin his generations, and Noah walked with God.\n\n6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\n6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled\nwith violence.\n\n6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for\nall flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n\n6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;\nfor the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I\nwill destroy them with the earth.\n\n6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the\nark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\n\n6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length\nof the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty\ncubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n\n6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou\nfinish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side\nthereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n\n6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the\nearth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under\nheaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\n\n6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come\ninto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives\nwith thee.\n\n6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt\nthou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be\nmale and female.\n\n6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of\nevery creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort\nshall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\n\n6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt\ngather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n\n6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did\nhe.\n\n7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the\nark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.\n\n7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male\nand his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and\nhis female.\n\n7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to\nkeep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.\n\n7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth\nforty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have\nmade will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\n\n7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.\n\n7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was\nupon the earth.\n\n7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives\nwith him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n\n7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,\nand of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two\nand two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had\ncommanded Noah.\n\n7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the\nflood were upon the earth.\n\n7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,\nthe seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains\nof the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n\n7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n\n7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,\nthe sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons\nwith them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind,\nand all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,\nevery bird of every sort.\n\n7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all\nflesh, wherein is the breath of life.\n\n7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as\nGod had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\n\n7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters\nincreased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.\n\n7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the\nearth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.\n\n7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the\nhigh hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.\n\n7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains\nwere covered.\n\n7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and\nof cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth\nupon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the\nbreath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.\n\n7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face\nof the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the\nfowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah\nonly remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\n\n7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty\ndays.\n\n8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the\ncattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over\nthe earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep\nand the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was\nrestrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth\ncontinually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the\nwaters were abated.\n\n8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of\nthe month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n\n8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the\ntenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the\nmountains seen.\n\n8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the\nwindow of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,\nwhich went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off\nthe earth.\n\n8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were\nabated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest\nfor the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for\nthe waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his\nhand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.\n\n8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the\ndove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;\nand, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that\nthe waters were abated from off the earth.\n\n8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;\nwhich returned not again unto him any more.\n\n8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the\nfirst month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from\noff the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,\nand, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\n\n8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the\nmonth, was the earth dried.\n\n8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,\nand thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n\n8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of\nall flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing\nthat creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the\nearth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.\n\n8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'\nwives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every\nfowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went\nforth out of the ark.\n\n8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean\nbeast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the\naltar.\n\n8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his\nheart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for\nthe imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I\nagain smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\n\n8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and\nheat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n\n9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be\nfruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n\n9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast\nof the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth\nupon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are\nthey delivered.\n\n9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the\ngreen herb have I given you all things.\n\n9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall\nye not eat.\n\n9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of\nevery beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of\nevery man's brother will I require the life of man.\n\n9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in\nthe image of God made he man.\n\n9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in\nthe earth, and multiply therein.\n\n9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And\nI, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after\nyou; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the\nfowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from\nall that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\n\n9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all\nflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall\nthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\n\n9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make\nbetween me and you and every living creature that is with you, for\nperpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall\nbe for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\n\n9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,\nthat the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my\ncovenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all\nflesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all\nflesh.\n\n9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that\nI may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living\ncreature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\n\n9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which\nI have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n\n9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and\nHam, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\n\n9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth\noverspread.\n\n9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\n9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered\nwithin his tent.\n\n9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,\nand told his two brethren without.\n\n9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their\nshoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their\nfather; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's\nnakedness.\n\n9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had\ndone unto him.\n\n9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be\nunto his brethren.\n\n9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be\nhis servant.\n\n9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of\nShem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n\n9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n\n9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and\nhe died.\n\n10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and\nJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\n\n10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and\nTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n\n10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n\n10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and\nDodanim.\n\n10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;\nevery one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n\n10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\n\n10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,\nand Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.\n\n10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n\n10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,\nEven as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\n\n10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and\nAccad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n\n10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the\ncity Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:\nthe same is a great city.\n\n10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and\nCaphtorim.\n\n10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the\nJebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,\nand the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the\nZemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the\nCanaanites spread abroad.\n\n10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest\nto Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and\nAdmah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.\n\n10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their\ntongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\n\n10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the\nbrother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.\n\n10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,\nand Aram.\n\n10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n\n10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.\n\n10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for\nin his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.\n\n10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and\nJerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and\nAbimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these\nwere the sons of Joktan.\n\n10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a\nmount of the east.\n\n10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their\ntongues, in their lands, after their nations.\n\n10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their\ngenerations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided\nin the earth after the flood.\n\n11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\n\n11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they\nfound a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\n\n11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn\nthem thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for\nmorter.\n\n11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose\ntop may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be\nscattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\n\n11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the\nchildren of men builded.\n\n11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all\none language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be\nrestrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n\n11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that\nthey may not understand one another's speech.\n\n11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of\nall the earth: and they left off to build the city.\n\n11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did\nthere confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the\nLORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\n\n11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years\nold, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem\nlived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n\n11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13\nAnd Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,\nand begat sons and daughters.\n\n11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah\nlived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n\n11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And\nEber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and\nbegat sons and daughters.\n\n11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg\nlived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n\n11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And\nReu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n\n11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug\nlived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n\n11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25\nAnd Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,\nand begat sons and daughters.\n\n11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and\nHaran.\n\n11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,\nNahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.\n\n11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his\nnativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\n\n11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife\nwas Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of\nHaran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.\n\n11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n\n11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's\nson, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they\nwent forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of\nCanaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.\n\n11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah\ndied in Haran.\n\n12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,\nand from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I\nwill shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I\nwill bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a\nblessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him\nthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be\nblessed.\n\n12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went\nwith him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed\nout of Haran.\n\n12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all\ntheir substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had\ngotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;\nand into the land of Canaan they came.\n\n12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto\nthe plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n\n12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I\ngive this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who\nappeared unto him.\n\n12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,\nand pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:\nand there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name\nof the LORD.\n\n12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\n\n12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into\nEgypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.\n\n12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,\nthat he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a\nfair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when\nthe Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:\nand they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n\n12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with\nme for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\n\n12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the\nEgyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\n\n12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before\nPharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.\n\n12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and\noxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,\nand camels.\n\n12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues\nbecause of Sarai Abram's wife.\n\n12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast\ndone unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19\nWhy saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to\nwife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\n\n12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him\naway, and his wife, and all that he had.\n\n13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he\nhad, and Lot with him, into the south.\n\n13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n\n13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto\nthe place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and\nHai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the\nfirst: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\n\n13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and\ntents.\n\n13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell\ntogether: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell\ntogether.\n\n13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and\nthe herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite\ndwelled then in the land.\n\n13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,\nbetween me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be\nbrethren.\n\n13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,\nfrom me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;\nor if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\n\n13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,\nthat it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom\nand Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,\nas thou comest unto Zoar.\n\n13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed\neast: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n\n13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the\ncities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\n\n13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD\nexceedingly.\n\n13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from\nhim, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art\nnorthward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all\nthe land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for\never.\n\n13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a\nman can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be\nnumbered.\n\n13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the\nbreadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.\n\n13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of\nMamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.\n\n14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,\nArioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of\nnations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with\nBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of\nZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\n\n14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is\nthe salt sea.\n\n14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year\nthey rebelled.\n\n14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that\nwere with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the\nZuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the\nHorites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n\n14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and\nsmote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that\ndwelt in Hazezontamar.\n\n14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,\nand the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela\n(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of\nSiddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king\nof nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;\nfour kings with five.\n\n14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of\nSodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled\nto the mountain.\n\n14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their\nvictuals, and went their way.\n\n14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,\nand his goods, and departed.\n\n14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;\nfor he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and\nbrother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.\n\n14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he\narmed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and\neighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.\n\n14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by\nnight, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the\nleft hand of Damascus.\n\n14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his\nbrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\n\n14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from\nthe slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at\nthe valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.\n\n14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and\nhe was the priest of the most high God.\n\n14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high\nGod, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most high\nGod, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him\ntithes of all.\n\n14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and\ntake the goods to thyself.\n\n14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand\nunto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,\n14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and\nthat I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,\nI have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men have\neaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,\nand Mamre; let them take their portion.\n\n15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a\nvision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding\ngreat reward.\n\n15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go\nchildless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?\n15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,\none born in my house is mine heir.\n\n15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This\nshall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own\nbowels shall be thine heir.\n\n15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward\nheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he\nsaid unto him, So shall thy seed be.\n\n15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for\nrighteousness.\n\n15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur\nof the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n\n15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit\nit?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,\nand a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a\nturtledove, and a young pigeon.\n\n15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,\nand laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\n\n15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them\naway.\n\n15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;\nand, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n\n15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be\na stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and\nthey shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that\nnation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they\ncome out with great substance.\n\n15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried\nin a good old age.\n\n15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for\nthe iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\n\n15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was\ndark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between\nthose pieces.\n\n15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,\nUnto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the\ngreat river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the\nKenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the\nPerizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the\nCanaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\n\n16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an\nhandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n\n16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained\nme from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may\nobtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n\n16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after\nAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her\nhusband Abram to be his wife.\n\n16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw\nthat she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n\n16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my\nmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was\ndespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.\n\n16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do\nto her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she\nfled from her face.\n\n16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the\nwilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n\n16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither\nwilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n\n16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,\nand submit thyself under her hands.\n\n16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy\nseed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n\n16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with\nchild and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because\nthe LORD hath heard thy affliction.\n\n16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,\nand every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence\nof all his brethren.\n\n16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou\nGod seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that\nseeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,\nit is between Kadesh and Bered.\n\n16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,\nwhich Hagar bare, Ishmael.\n\n16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare\nIshmael to Abram.\n\n17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared\nto Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,\nand be thou perfect.\n\n17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will\nmultiply thee exceedingly.\n\n17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4\nAs for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a\nfather of many nations.\n\n17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name\nshall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.\n\n17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations\nof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\n\n17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed\nafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a\nGod unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\n\n17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land\nwherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an\neverlasting possession; and I will be their God.\n\n17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,\nthou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.\n\n17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and\nthy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.\n\n17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall\nbe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.\n\n17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,\nevery man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or\nbought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.\n\n17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy\nmoney, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your\nflesh for an everlasting covenant.\n\n17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is\nnot circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath\nbroken my covenant.\n\n17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not\ncall her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n\n17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I\nwill bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people\nshall be of her.\n\n17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his\nheart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?\nand shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham\nsaid unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And God\nsaid, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call\nhis name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an\neverlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.\n\n17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed\nhim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;\ntwelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\n\n17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall\nbear unto thee at this set time in the next year.\n\n17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n\n17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his\nhouse, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the\nmen of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in\nthe selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\n\n17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n\n17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n\n17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his\nson.\n\n17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with\nmoney of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\n\n18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat\nin the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes\nand looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he\nran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the\nground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy\nsight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little\nwater, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves\nunder the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort\nye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come\nto your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n\n18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make\nready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes\nupon the hearth.\n\n18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,\nand gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n\n18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,\nand set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they\ndid eat.\n\n18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,\nBehold, in the tent.\n\n18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the\ntime of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah\nheard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n\n18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it\nceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n\n18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed\nold shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD\nsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a\nsurety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard for\nthe LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to\nthe time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n\n18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.\nAnd he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n\n18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and\nAbraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n\n18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I\ndo; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty\nnation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his\nhousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do\njustice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which\nhe hath spoken of him.\n\n18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is\ngreat, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down\nnow, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of\nit, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\n\n18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward\nSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n\n18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the\nrighteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fifty\nrighteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the\nplace for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be far\nfrom thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the\nwicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far\nfrom thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 And\nthe LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,\nthen I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n\n18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me\nto speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28\nPeradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou\ndestroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there\nforty and five, I will not destroy it.\n\n18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there\nshall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's\nsake.\n\n18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will\nspeak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I\nwill not do it, if I find thirty there.\n\n18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the\nLORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I\nwill not destroy it for twenty's sake.\n\n18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet\nbut this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I\nwill not destroy it for ten's sake.\n\n18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with\nAbraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n\n19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the\ngate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed\nhimself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,\nmy lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry\nall night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on\nyour ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all\nnight.\n\n19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,\nand entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake\nunleavened bread, and they did eat.\n\n19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of\nSodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people\nfrom every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,\nWhere are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out\nunto us, that we may know them.\n\n19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after\nhim, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n\n19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let\nme, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good\nin your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they\nunder the shadow of my roof.\n\n19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow\ncame in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal\nworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,\neven Lot, and came near to break the door.\n\n19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house\nto them, and shut to the door.\n\n19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with\nblindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to\nfind the door.\n\n19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in\nlaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the\ncity, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy this\nplace, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the\nLORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.\n\n19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married\nhis daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD\nwill destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons\nin law.\n\n19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,\nsaying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;\nlest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n\n19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon\nthe hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD\nbeing merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him\nwithout the city.\n\n19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,\nthat he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay\nthou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\n\n19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,\nthy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy\nmercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot\nescape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20\nBehold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:\nOh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall\nlive.\n\n19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this\nthing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou\nhast spoken.\n\n19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou\nbe come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n\n19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n\n19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and\nfire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,\nand all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that\nwhich grew upon the ground.\n\n19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\npillar of salt.\n\n19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he\nstood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,\nand toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke\nof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n\n19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,\nthat God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the\noverthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\n\n19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his\ntwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt\nin a cave, he and his two daughters.\n\n19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and\nthere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of\nall the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we\nwill lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n\n19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the\nfirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when\nshe lay down, nor when she arose.\n\n19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto\nthe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him\ndrink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we\nmay preserve seed of our father.\n\n19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the\nyounger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay\ndown, nor when she arose.\n\n19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n\n19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the\nsame is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\n\n19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name\nBenammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this\nday.\n\n20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and\ndwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n\n20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and\nAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n\n20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,\nBehold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;\nfor she is a man's wife.\n\n20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou\nslay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my\nsister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the\nintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n\n20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst\nthis in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from\nsinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n\n20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and\nhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her\nnot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are\nthine.\n\n20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his\nservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were\nsore afraid.\n\n20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou\ndone unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on\nme and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that\nought not to be done.\n\n20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou\nhast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,\nSurely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for\nmy wife's sake.\n\n20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my\nfather, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n\n20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my\nfather's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou\nshalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,\nHe is my brother.\n\n20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\nwomenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his\nwife.\n\n20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where\nit pleaseth thee.\n\n20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a\nthousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the\neyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was\nreproved.\n\n20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his\nwife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\n\n20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of\nAbimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n\n21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto\nSarah as he had spoken.\n\n21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at\nthe set time of which God had spoken to him.\n\n21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,\nwhom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n\n21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as\nGod had commanded him.\n\n21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born\nunto him.\n\n21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear\nwill laugh with me.\n\n21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should\nhave given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.\n\n21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great\nfeast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n\n21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born\nunto Abraham, mocking.\n\n21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her\nson: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even\nwith Isaac.\n\n21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of\nhis son.\n\n21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight\nbecause of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah\nhath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy\nseed be called.\n\n21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,\nbecause he is thy seed.\n\n21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a\nbottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,\nand the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in\nthe wilderness of Beersheba.\n\n21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child\nunder one of the shrubs.\n\n21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,\nas it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the\nchild. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.\n\n21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called\nto Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?\nfear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.\n\n21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will\nmake him a great nation.\n\n21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she\nwent, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n\n21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the\nwilderness, and became an archer.\n\n21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him\na wife out of the land of Egypt.\n\n21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the\nchief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee\nin all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God\nthat thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my\nson's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,\nthou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n\n21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n\n21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which\nAbimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n\n21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither\ndidst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.\n\n21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;\nand both of them made a covenant.\n\n21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n\n21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs\nwhich thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these seven\newe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto\nme, that I have digged this well.\n\n21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they\nsware both of them.\n\n21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,\nand Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the\nland of the Philistines.\n\n21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on\nthe name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n\n21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n\n22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\nAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\n\n22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou\nlovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for\na burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\n\n22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,\nand took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave\nthe wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place\nof which God had told him.\n\n22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the\nplace afar off.\n\n22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;\nand I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\n\n22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon\nIsaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they\nwent both of them together.\n\n22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and\nhe said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:\nbut where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, My\nson, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they\nwent both of them together.\n\n22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham\nbuilt an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his\nson, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n\n22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay\nhis son.\n\n22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and\nsaid, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n\n22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou\nany thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou\nhast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\n\n22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind\nhim a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took\nthe ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his\nson.\n\n22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is\nsaid to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.\n\n22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the\nsecond time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,\nfor because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,\nthine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in\nmultiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and\nas the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess\nthe gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations\nof the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n\n22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and\nwent together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.\n\n22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told\nAbraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy\nbrother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and\nKemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,\nand Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n\n22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,\nAbraham's brother.\n\n22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,\nand Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n\n23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these\nwere the years of the life of Sarah.\n\n23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of\nCanaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n\n23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the\nsons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:\ngive me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my\ndead out of my sight.\n\n23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6\nHear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of\nour sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his\nsepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\n\n23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the\nland, even to the children of Heth.\n\n23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I\nshould bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to\nEphron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of\nMachpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as\nmuch money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a\nburyingplace amongst you.\n\n23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the\nHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even\nof all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my\nlord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I\ngive it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:\nbury thy dead.\n\n23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\n\n23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the\nland, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will\ngive thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead\nthere.\n\n23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,\nhearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;\nwhat is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n\n23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron\nthe silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,\nfour hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\n\n23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before\nMamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees\nthat were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were\nmade sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the\nchildren of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\n\n23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the\nfield of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of\nCanaan.\n\n23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto\nAbraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.\n\n24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had\nblessed Abraham in all things.\n\n24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled\nover all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3\nAnd I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God\nof the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the\ndaughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt\ngo unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son\nIsaac.\n\n24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be\nwilling to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again\nunto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto\nhim, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\n\n24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and\nfrom the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware\nunto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send\nhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from\nthence.\n\n24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou\nshalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n\n24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his\nmaster, and sware to him concerning that matter.\n\n24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and\ndeparted; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he\narose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\n\n24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well\nof water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out\nto draw water.\n\n24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send\nme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.\n\n24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of\nthe men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to\npass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I\npray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give\nthy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed\nfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed\nkindness unto my master.\n\n24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,\nRebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of\nNahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n\n24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had\nany man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her\npitcher, and came up.\n\n24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,\ndrink a little water of thy pitcher.\n\n24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her\npitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\n\n24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw\nwater for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\n\n24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran\nagain unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\n\n24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the\nLORD had made his journey prosperous or not.\n\n24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the\nman took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets\nfor her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose\ndaughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's\nhouse for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the\ndaughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.\n\n24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender\nenough, and room to lodge in.\n\n24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\n\n24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who\nhath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being\nin the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.\n\n24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these\nthings.\n\n24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran\nout unto the man, unto the well.\n\n24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon\nhis sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,\nsaying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,\nbehold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n\n24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore\nstandest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the\ncamels.\n\n24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and\ngave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,\nand the men's feet that were with him.\n\n24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will\nnot eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n\n24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\n\n24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become\ngreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,\nand menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\n\n24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was\nold: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.\n\n24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife\nto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and\ntake a wife unto my son.\n\n24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not\nfollow me.\n\n24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his\nangel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for\nmy son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thou\nbe clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if\nthey give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n\n24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my\nmaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43\nBehold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that\nwhen the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,\nI pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say\nto me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the\nsame be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's\nson.\n\n24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah\ncame forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto\nthe well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray\nthee.\n\n24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,\nand said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,\nand she made the camels drink also.\n\n24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she\nsaid, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:\nand I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n\n24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed\nthe LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way\nto take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.\n\n24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell\nme: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the\nleft.\n\n24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth\nfrom the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\n\n24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be\nthy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.\n\n24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their\nwords, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\n\n24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of\ngold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her\nbrother and to her mother precious things.\n\n24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,\nand tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,\nSend me away unto my master.\n\n24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with\nus a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n\n24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath\nprospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n\n24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her\nmouth.\n\n24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with\nthis man? And she said, I will go.\n\n24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and\nAbraham's servant, and his men.\n\n24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our\nsister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed\npossess the gate of those which hate them.\n\n24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the\ncamels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went\nhis way.\n\n24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt\nin the south country.\n\n24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and\nhe lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.\n\n24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she\nlighted off the camel.\n\n24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh\nin the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:\ntherefore she took a vail, and covered herself.\n\n24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n\n24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took\nRebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was\ncomforted after his mother's death.\n\n25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\n\n25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and\nIshbak, and Shuah.\n\n25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were\nAsshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n\n25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,\nand Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n\n25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n\n25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham\ngave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,\neastward, unto the east country.\n\n25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he\nlived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\n\n25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an\nold man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\n\n25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of\nMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which\nis before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons\nof Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n\n25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed\nhis son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.\n\n25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom\nHagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And\nthese are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according\nto their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,\nand Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15\nHadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons\nof Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their\ncastles; twelve princes according to their nations.\n\n25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and\nthirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was\ngathered unto his people.\n\n25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as\nthou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his\nbrethren.\n\n25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham\nbegat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah\nto wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister\nto Laban the Syrian.\n\n25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was\nbarren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife\nconceived.\n\n25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If\nit be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.\n\n25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two\nmanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one\npeople shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall\nserve the younger.\n\n25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there\nwere twins in her womb.\n\n25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and\nthey called his name Esau.\n\n25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on\nEsau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore\nyears old when she bare them.\n\n25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the\nfield; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n\n25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but\nRebekah loved Jacob.\n\n25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was\nfaint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that\nsame red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n\n25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\n\n25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit\nshall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me\nthis day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto\nJacob.\n\n25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did\neat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his\nbirthright.\n\n26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that\nwas in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the\nPhilistines unto Gerar.\n\n26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;\ndwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this\nland, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and\nunto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the\noath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thy\nseed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed\nall these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the\nearth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept\nmy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n\n26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him\nof his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She\nis my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for\nRebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\n\n26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that\nAbimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,\nand, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n\n26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is\nthy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto\nhim, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n\n26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of\nthe people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest\nhave brought guiltiness upon us.\n\n26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth\nthis man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n\n26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an\nhundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.\n\n26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he\nbecame very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and\npossession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines\nenvied him.\n\n26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the\ndays of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and\nfilled them with earth.\n\n26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much\nmightier than we.\n\n26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of\nGerar, and dwelt there.\n\n26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged\nin the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped\nthem after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the\nnames by which his father had called them.\n\n26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a\nwell of springing water.\n\n26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,\nsaying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;\nbecause they strove with him.\n\n26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he\ncalled the name of it Sitnah.\n\n26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for\nthat they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he\nsaid, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful\nin the land.\n\n26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.\n\n26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am\nthe God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.\n\n26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the\nLORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a\nwell.\n\n26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his\nfriends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n\n26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye\nhate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw\ncertainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now\nan oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a\ncovenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not\ntouched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have\nsent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\n\n26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n\n26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to\nanother: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in\npeace.\n\n26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,\nand told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto\nhim, We have found water.\n\n26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is\nBeersheba unto this day.\n\n26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the\ndaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the\nHittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n\n27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were\ndim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said\nunto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.\n\n27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my\ndeath: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver\nand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4\nAnd make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I\nmay eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n\n27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went\nto the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n\n27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy\nfather speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and\nmake me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD\nbefore my death.\n\n27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I\ncommand thee.\n\n27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of\nthe goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as\nhe loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may\neat, and that he may bless thee before his death.\n\n27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is\na hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will\nfeel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a\ncurse upon me, and not a blessing.\n\n27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only\nobey my voice, and go fetch me them.\n\n27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and\nhis mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n\n27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which\nwere with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:\n27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,\nand upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat\nand the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n\n27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,\nHere am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his\nfather, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest\nme: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may\nbless me.\n\n27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it\nso quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it\nto me.\n\n27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may\nfeel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n\n27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and\nsaid, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n\n27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his\nbrother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.\n\n27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n\n27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's\nvenison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,\nand he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.\n\n27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,\nmy son.\n\n27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of\nhis raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as\nthe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore God\ngive thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and\nplenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow\ndown to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow\ndown to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he\nthat blesseth thee.\n\n27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of\nblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of\nIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n\n27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his\nfather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his\nson's venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n\n27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I\nam thy son, thy firstborn Esau.\n\n27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he\nthat hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all\nbefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be\nblessed.\n\n27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a\ngreat and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,\neven me also, O my father.\n\n27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away\nthy blessing.\n\n27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath\nsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,\nbehold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not\nreserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto\nEsau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I\ngiven to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained\nhim: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said\nunto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even\nme also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n\n27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy\ndwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven\nfrom above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve\nthy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the\ndominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n\n27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his\nfather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning\nfor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n\n27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and\nshe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,\nthy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to\nkill thee.\n\n27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban\nmy brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy\nbrother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn away\nfrom thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will\nsend, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you\nboth in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my\nlife because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the\ndaughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the\nland, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and\nblessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a\nwife of the daughters of Canaan.\n\n28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's\nfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy\nmother's brother.\n\n28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply\nthee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee\nthe blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou\nmayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave\nunto Abraham.\n\n28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,\nson of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's\nmother.\n\n28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to\nPadanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him\nhe gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the\ndaughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his\nmother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the\ndaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esau\nunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the\ndaughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his\nwife.\n\n28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n\n28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all\nnight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that\nplace, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to\nsleep.\n\n28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the\ntop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending\nand descending on it.\n\n28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD\nGod of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou\nliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed\nshall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the\nwest, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee\nand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n\n28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places\nwhither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I\nwill not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to\nthee of.\n\n28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD\nis in this place; and I knew it not.\n\n28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is\nnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n\n28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that\nhe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil\nupon the top of it.\n\n28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of\nthat city was called Luz at the first.\n\n28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will\nkeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and\nraiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in\npeace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which I\nhave set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou\nshalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\n\n29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the\npeople of the east.\n\n29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there\nwere three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they\nwatered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.\n\n29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the\nstone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone\nagain upon the well's mouth in his place.\n\n29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they\nsaid, Of Haran are we.\n\n29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they\nsaid, We know him.\n\n29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:\nand, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n\n29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the\ncattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and\nfeed them.\n\n29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered\ntogether, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we\nwater the sheep.\n\n29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's\nsheep; for she kept them.\n\n29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban\nhis mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,\nthat Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and\nwatered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.\n\n29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n\n29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that\nhe was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n\n29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his\nsister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed\nhim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n\n29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And\nhe abode with him the space of a month.\n\n29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,\nshouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy\nwages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder\nwas Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n\n29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well\nfavoured.\n\n29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years\nfor Rachel thy younger daughter.\n\n29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that\nI should give her to another man: abide with me.\n\n29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto\nhim but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n\n29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are\nfulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n\n29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a\nfeast.\n\n29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his\ndaughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n\n29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an\nhandmaid.\n\n29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:\nand he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I\nserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give\nthe younger before the firstborn.\n\n29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service\nwhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n\n29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel\nhis daughter to wife also.\n\n29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be\nher maid.\n\n29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more\nthan Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n\n29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:\nbut Rachel was barren.\n\n29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name\nReuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;\nnow therefore my husband will love me.\n\n29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the\nLORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:\nand she called his name Simeon.\n\n29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time\nwill my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:\ntherefore was his name called Levi.\n\n29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will\nI praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left\nbearing.\n\n30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel\nenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I\ndie.\n\n30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I\nin God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she\nshall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.\n\n30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in\nunto her.\n\n30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n\n30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my\nvoice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\n\n30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second\nson.\n\n30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my\nsister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n\n30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her\nmaid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n\n30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.\n\n30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\n\n30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.\n\n30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me\nblessed: and she called his name Asher.\n\n30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found\nmandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then\nRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.\n\n30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken\nmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And\nRachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's\nmandrakes.\n\n30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went\nout to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I\nhave hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that\nnight.\n\n30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob\nthe fifth son.\n\n30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given\nmy maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n\n30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n\n30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my\nhusband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she\ncalled his name Zebulun.\n\n30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n\n30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened\nher womb.\n\n30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away\nmy reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD\nshall add to me another son.\n\n30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob\nsaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and\nto my country.\n\n30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,\nand let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\n\n30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in\nthine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath\nblessed me for thy sake.\n\n30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n\n30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and\nhow thy cattle was with me.\n\n30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now\nincreased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my\ncoming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31\nAnd he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not\ngive me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again\nfeed and keep thy flock.\n\n30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence\nall the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among\nthe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such\nshall be my hire.\n\n30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it\nshall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled\nand spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be\ncounted stolen with me.\n\n30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy\nword.\n\n30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and\nspotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and\nevery one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the\nsheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n\n30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and\nJacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n\n30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and\nchesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white\nappear which was in the rods.\n\n30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the\ngutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that\nthey should conceive when they came to drink.\n\n30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\ncattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n\n30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the\nflocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of\nLaban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto\nLaban's cattle.\n\n30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did\nconceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in\nthe gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n\n30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the\nfeebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n\n30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and\nmaidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n\n31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken\naway all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's\nhath he gotten all this glory.\n\n31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was\nnot toward him as before.\n\n31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy\nfathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n\n31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his\nflock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that\nit is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with\nme.\n\n31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n\n31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;\nbut God suffered him not to hurt me.\n\n31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the\ncattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be\nthy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n\n31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given\nthem to me.\n\n31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that\nI lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which\nleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.\n\n31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:\nAnd I said, Here am I.\n\n31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which\nleap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I\nhave seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n\n31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and\nwhere thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this\nland, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n\n31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any\nportion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we not\ncounted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured\nalso our money.\n\n31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is\nours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto\nthee, do.\n\n31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;\n31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he\nhad gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in\nPadanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n\n31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the\nimages that were her father's.\n\n31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he\ntold him not that he fled.\n\n31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over\nthe river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n\n31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n\n31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven\ndays' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n\n31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said\nunto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n\n31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the\nmount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n\n31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\nstolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives\ntaken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,\nand steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent\nthee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou\nhast now done foolishly in so doing.\n\n31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\nyour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that\nthou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n\n31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\nlongedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my\ngods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was\nafraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\ndaughters from me.\n\n31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before\nour brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.\nFor Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n\n31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into\nthe two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out\nof Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\n\n31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's\nfurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but\nfound them not.\n\n31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I\ncannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he\nsearched but found not the images.\n\n31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\nand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast\nso hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my\nstuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here\nbefore my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us\nboth.\n\n31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\ngoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not\neaten.\n\n31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\nthe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by\nday, or stolen by night.\n\n31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by\nnight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n\n31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\nfourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:\nand thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n\n31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of\nIsaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God\nhath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee\nyesternight.\n\n31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\ndaughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my\ncattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day\nunto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?\n31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and\nlet it be for a witness between me and thee.\n\n31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n\n31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\nstones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\n\n31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\n\n31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this\nday.\n\nTherefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he\nsaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from\nanother.\n\n31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other\nwives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness\nbetwixt me and thee.\n\n31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\npillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be\nwitness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this\nheap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this\npillar unto me, for harm.\n\n31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\nfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father\nIsaac.\n\n31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\nbrethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night\nin the mount.\n\n31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and\nhis daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto\nhis place.\n\n32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n\n32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he\ncalled the name of that place Mahanaim.\n\n32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the\nland of Seir, the country of Edom.\n\n32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord\nEsau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and\nstayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and\nmenservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that\nI may find grace in thy sight.\n\n32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\nbrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men\nwith him.\n\n32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the\npeople that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,\ninto two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and\nsmite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\n\n32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father\nIsaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to\nthy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of\nthe least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast\nshewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;\nand now I am become two bands.\n\n32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\nhand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the\nmother with the children.\n\n32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\nas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n\n32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came\nto his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she\ngoats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15\nThirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,\ntwenty she asses, and ten foals.\n\n32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove\nby themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and\nput a space betwixt drove and drove.\n\n32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\nmeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither\ngoest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt\nsay, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord\nEsau: and, behold, also he is behind us.\n\n32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\nfollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,\nwhen ye find him.\n\n32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For\nhe said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and\nafterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n\n32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\nnight in the company.\n\n32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\nwomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n\n32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\nthat he had.\n\n32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\nuntil the breaking of the day.\n\n32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\nthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of\njoint, as he wrestled with him.\n\n32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I\nwill not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n\n32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n\n32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:\nfor as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast\nprevailed.\n\n32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.\nAnd he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he\nblessed him there.\n\n32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen\nGod face to face, and my life is preserved.\n\n32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he\nhalted upon his thigh.\n\n32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which\nshrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because\nhe touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.\n\n33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,\nand with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,\nand unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.\n\n33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah\nand her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n\n33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground\nseven times, until he came near to his brother.\n\n33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,\nand kissed him: and they wept.\n\n33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\nand said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God\nhath graciously given thy servant.\n\n33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they\nbowed themselves.\n\n33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:\nand after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n\n33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And\nhe said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n\n33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast\nunto thyself.\n\n33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in\nthy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have\nseen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast\npleased with me.\n\n33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because\nGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he\nurged him, and he took it.\n\n33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will\ngo before thee.\n\n33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are\ntender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men\nshould overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n\n33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I\nwill lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and\nthe children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\n\n33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that\nare with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the\nsight of my lord.\n\n33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n\n33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made\nbooths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called\nSuccoth.\n\n33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the\nland of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent\nbefore the city.\n\n33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,\nat the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred\npieces of money.\n\n33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\n\n34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went\nout to see the daughters of the land.\n\n34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the\ncountry, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\n\n34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved\nthe damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\n\n34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this\ndamsel to wife.\n\n34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his\nsons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until\nthey were come.\n\n34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune\nwith him.\n\n34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:\nand the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had\nwrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing\nought not to be done.\n\n34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem\nlongeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.\n\n34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,\nand take our daughters unto you.\n\n34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;\ndwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n\n34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me\nfind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.\n\n34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according\nas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n\n34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father\ndeceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:\n34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our\nsister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:\n34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,\nthat every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our\ndaughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will\ndwell with you, and we will become one people.\n\n34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will\nwe take our daughter, and we will be gone.\n\n34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n\n34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had\ndelight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the\nhouse of his father.\n\n34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,\nand communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are\npeaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade\ntherein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us\ntake their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our\ndaughters.\n\n34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,\nto be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are\ncircumcised.\n\n34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of\ntheir's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell\nwith us.\n\n34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went\nout of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that\nwent out of the gate of his city.\n\n34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that\ntwo of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each\nman his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.\n\n34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the\nsword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.\n\n34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,\nbecause they had defiled their sister.\n\n34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that\nwhich was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all\ntheir wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they\ncaptive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.\n\n34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make\nme to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites\nand the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather\nthemselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,\nI and my house.\n\n34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?\n35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:\nand make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou\nfleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\n\n35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with\nhim, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and\nchange your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and\nI will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my\ndistress, and was with me in the way which I went.\n\n35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their\nhand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid\nthem under the oak which was by Shechem.\n\n35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities\nthat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of\nJacob.\n\n35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,\nBethel, he and all the people that were with him.\n\n35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:\nbecause there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his\nbrother.\n\n35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath\nBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.\n\n35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,\nand blessed him.\n\n35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be\ncalled any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his\nname Israel.\n\n35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and\nmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and\nkings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave\nAbraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee\nwill I give the land.\n\n35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\n\n35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,\neven a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he\npoured oil thereon.\n\n35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,\nBethel.\n\n35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way\nto come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.\n\n35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the\nmidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.\n\n35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she\ndied) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him\nBenjamin.\n\n35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is\nBethlehem.\n\n35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of\nRachel's grave unto this day.\n\n35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of\nEdar.\n\n35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben\nwent and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.\nNow the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,\nJacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and\nZebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the\nsons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the\nsons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of\nJacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.\n\n35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city\nof Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n\n35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.\n\n35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his\npeople, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried\nhim.\n\n36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.\n\n36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan;

and went into\nthe country from the face of his brother Jacob.\n\n36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;\nand the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because\nof their cattle.\n\n36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n\n36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites\nin mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons;

and Lotan's\nsister was Timna.\n\n36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and\nEbal, Shepho, and Onam.\n\n36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this\nwas that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the\nasses of Zibeon his father.\n\n36:25 And the children of Anah were these;

duke\nTimnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah,\nduke Pinon, 36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 Duke\nMagdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their\nhabitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of\nthe Edomites.\n\n37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in\nthe land of Canaan.\n\n37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years\nold, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the\nsons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and\nJoseph brought unto his father their evil report.\n\n37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he\nwas the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.\n\n37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than\nall his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto\nhim.\n\n37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they\nhated him yet the more.\n\n37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have\ndreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,\nlo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves\nstood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.\n\n37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or\nshalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the\nmore for his dreams, and for his words.\n\n37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and\nsaid, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and\nthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\n\n37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his\nfather rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou\nhast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to\nbow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethren\nenvied him; but his father observed the saying.\n\n37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.\n\n37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock\nin Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,\nHere am I.\n\n37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with\nthy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he\nsent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\n\n37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in\nthe field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16\nAnd he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed\ntheir flocks.\n\n37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,\nLet us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found\nthem in Dothan.\n\n37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto\nthem, they conspired against him to slay him.\n\n37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\n\n37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some\npit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall\nsee what will become of his dreams.\n\n37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;\nand said, Let us not kill him.\n\n37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this\npit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might\nrid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\n\n37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,\nthat they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that\nwas on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the\npit was empty, there was no water in it.\n\n37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes\nand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead\nwith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry\nit down to Egypt.\n\n37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay\nour brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him\nto the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our\nbrother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.\n\n37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and\nlifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites\nfor twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n\n37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in\nthe pit; and he rent his clothes.\n\n37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;\nand I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and\nkilled a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And\nthey sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their\nfather; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's\ncoat or no.\n\n37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast\nhath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\n\n37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,\nand mourned for his son many days.\n\n37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;\nbut he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into\nthe grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.\n\n37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer\nof Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.\n\n38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his\nbrethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n\n38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name\nwas Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\n\n38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n\n38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name\nOnan.\n\n38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name\nShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\n\n38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.\n\n38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;\nand the LORD slew him.\n\n38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and\nmarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n\n38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to\npass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on\nthe ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.\n\n38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he\nslew him also.\n\n38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at\nthy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest\nperadventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and\ndwelt in her father's house.\n\n38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;\nand Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to\nTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\n\n38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up\nto Timnath to shear his sheep.\n\n38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her\nwith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is\nby the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was\nnot given unto him to wife.\n\n38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she\nhad covered her face.\n\n38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,\nlet me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter\nin law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come\nin unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.\nAnd she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18\nAnd he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,\nand thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it\nher, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.\n\n38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and\nput on the garments of her widowhood.\n\n38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,\nto receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.\n\n38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the\nharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no\nharlot in this place.\n\n38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also\nthe men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.\n\n38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:\nbehold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n\n38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told\nJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and\nalso, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her\nforth, and let her be burnt.\n\n38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,\nsaying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,\nDiscern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and\nstaff.\n\n38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more\nrighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he\nknew her again no more.\n\n38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,\ntwins were in her womb.\n\n38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out\nhis hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet\nthread, saying, This came out first.\n\n38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his\nbrother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this\nbreach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.\n\n38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread\nupon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\n\n39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of\nPharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of\nthe Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.\n\n39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he\nwas in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n\n39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD\nmade all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n\n39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he\nmade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his\nhand.\n\n39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer\nin his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the\nEgyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was\nupon all that he had in the house, and in the field.\n\n39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not\nought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly\nperson, and well favoured.\n\n39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife\ncast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n\n39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my\nmaster wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed\nall that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house\nthan I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because\nthou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin\nagainst God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by\nday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n\n39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the\nhouse to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house\nthere within.\n\n39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he\nleft his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n\n39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment\nin her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of\nher house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an\nHebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I\ncried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that\nI lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and\nfled, and got him out.\n\n39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\n\n39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The\nHebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to\nmock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,\nthat he left his garment with me, and fled out.\n\n39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his\nwife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy\nservant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n\n39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a\nplace where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the\nprison.\n\n39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him\nfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n\n39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the\nprisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he\nwas the doer of it.\n\n39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under\nhis hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the\nLORD made it to prosper.\n\n40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the\nking of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n\n40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the\nchief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n\n40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,\ninto the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n\n40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he\nserved them: and they continued a season in ward.\n\n40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one\nnight, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the\nbutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the\nprison.\n\n40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon\nthem, and, behold, they were sad.\n\n40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of\nhis lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And\nthey said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no\ninterpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations\nbelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n\n40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,\nIn my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were\nthree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot\nforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And\nPharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them\ninto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\n\n40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The\nthree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall\nPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou\nshalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner\nwhen thou wast his butler.\n\n40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\nkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,\nand bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out\nof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that\nthey should put me into the dungeon.\n\n40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\nsaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three\nwhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was\nof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out\nof the basket upon my head.\n\n40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\nthereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days\nshall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a\ntree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\n\n40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,\nthat he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head\nof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.\n\n40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and\nhe gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief\nbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n\n40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n\n41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\ndreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\n\n41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured\nkine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n\n41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\nriver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon\nthe brink of the river.\n\n41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\nwell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n\n41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears\nof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n\n41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\nsprung up after them.\n\n41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\nAnd Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n\n41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;\nand he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the\nwise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none\nthat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember\nmy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put\nme in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief\nbaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed\neach man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n\n41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to\nthe captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us\nour dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.\n\n41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he\nrestored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\n\n41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him\nhastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his\nraiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there\nis none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou\ncanst understand a dream to interpret it.\n\n41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall\ngive Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n\n41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon\nthe bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the\nriver seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a\nmeadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor\nand very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the\nland of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured\nkine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had\neaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but\nthey were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n\n41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one\nstalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,\nand blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the\nthin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the\nmagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\n\n41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God\nhath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n\n41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are\nseven years: the dream is one.\n\n41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them\nare seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind\nshall be seven years of famine.\n\n41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is\nabout to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all\nthe land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years\nof famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;\nand the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not\nbe known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall\nbe very grievous.\n\n41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is\nbecause the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it\nto pass.\n\n41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and\nset him over the land of Egypt.\n\n41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,\nand take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous\nyears.\n\n41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,\nand lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in\nthe cities.\n\n41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\nyears of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land\nperish not through the famine.\n\n41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\nof all his servants.\n\n41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as\nthis is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said\nunto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none\nso discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,\nand according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the\nthrone will I be greater than thou.\n\n41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the\nland of Egypt.\n\n41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon\nJoseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a\ngold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second\nchariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he\nmade him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee\nshall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave\nhim to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And\nJoseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh\nking of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and\nwent throughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by\nhandfuls.\n\n41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were\nin the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of\nthe field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.\n\n41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,\nuntil he left numbering; for it was without number.\n\n41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine\ncame, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto\nhim.\n\n41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,\nsaid he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.\n\n41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath\ncaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n\n41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of\nEgypt, were ended.\n\n41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph\nhad said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of\nEgypt there was bread.\n\n41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to\nPharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto\nJoseph; what he saith to you, do.\n\n41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph\nopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the\nfamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n\n41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;\nbecause that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n\n42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto\nhis sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,\nI have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and\nbuy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n\n42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n\n42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;\nfor he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n\n42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:\nfor the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n\n42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that\nsold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and\nbowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\n\n42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself\nstrange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,\nWhence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n\n42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n\n42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and\nsaid unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are\ncome.\n\n42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy\nservants come.\n\n42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no\nspies.\n\n42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land\nye are come.\n\n42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one\nman in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with\nour father, and one is not.\n\n42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,\nsaying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of\nPharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come\nhither.\n\n42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be\nkept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any\ntruth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.\n\n42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n\n42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for\nI fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound\nin the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your\nhouses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your\nwords be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n\n42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning\nour brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought\nus, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n\n42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,\nDo not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,\nbehold, also his blood is required.\n\n42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto\nthem by an interpreter.\n\n42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to\nthem again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and\nbound him before their eyes.\n\n42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to\nrestore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision\nfor the way: and thus did he unto them.\n\n42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n\n42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in\nthe inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.\n\n42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it\nis even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,\nsaying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29\nAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and\ntold him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the\nlord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the\ncountry.\n\n42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We\nbe twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest\nis this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n\n42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall\nI know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,\nand take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34\nAnd bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are\nno spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your\nbrother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n\n42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,\nevery man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and\ntheir father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\n\n42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my\nchildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin\naway: all these things are against me.\n\n42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I\nbring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him\nto thee again.\n\n42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother\nis dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in\nthe which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to\nthe grave.\n\n43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.\n\n43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they\nhad brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy\nus a little food.\n\n43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest\nunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with\nyou.\n\n43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy\nthee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:\nfor the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your\nbrother be with you.\n\n43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell\nthe man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man\nasked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your\nfather yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according\nto the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would\nsay, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his\nfather, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may\nlive, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.\n\n43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I\nbring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the\nblame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had\nreturned this second time.\n\n43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do\nthis; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry\ndown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and\nmyrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;\nand the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry\nit again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take\nalso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God\nAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your\nother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am\nbereaved.\n\n43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in\ntheir hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and\nstood before Joseph.\n\n43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of\nhis house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these\nmen shall dine with me at noon.\n\n43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into\nJoseph's house.\n\n43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's\nhouse; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our\nsacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion\nagainst us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.\n\n43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they\ncommuned with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we\ncame indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to\npass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,\nevery man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full\nweight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n\n43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:\nwe cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n\n43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of\nyour father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.\nAnd he brought Simeon out unto them.\n\n43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them\nwater, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n\n43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for\nthey heard that they should eat bread there.\n\n43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which\nwas in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the\nearth.\n\n43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father\nwell, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they\nanswered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.\nAnd they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.\n\n43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his\nmother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake\nunto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.\n\n43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his\nbrother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,\nand wept there.\n\n43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and\nsaid, Set on bread.\n\n43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,\nand for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because\nthe Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an\nabomination unto the Egyptians.\n\n43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his\nbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men\nmarvelled one at another.\n\n43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but\nBenjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they\ndrank, and were merry with him.\n\n44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's\nsacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money\nin his sack's mouth.\n\n44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the\nyoungest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that\nJoseph had spoken.\n\n44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they\nand their asses.\n\n44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,\nJoseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou\ndost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for\ngood?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby\nindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n\n44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n\n44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God\nforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8\nBehold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought\nagain unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal\nout of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy\nservants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's\nbondmen.\n\n44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he\nwith whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.\n\n44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,\nand opened every man his sack.\n\n44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the\nyoungest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n\n44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and\nreturned to the city.\n\n44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was\nyet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n\n44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?\nwot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah\nsaid, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how\nshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy\nservants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with\nwhom the cup is found.\n\n44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in\nwhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,\nget you up in peace unto your father.\n\n44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy\nservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not\nthine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.\n\n44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a\nbrother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old\nman, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is\ndead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n\n44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that\nI may set mine eyes upon him.\n\n44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for\nif he should leave his father, his father would die.\n\n44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother\ncome down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n\n44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,\nwe told him the words of my lord.\n\n44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n\n44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with\nus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except\nour youngest brother be with us.\n\n44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife\nbare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,\nSurely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye\ntake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down\nmy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n\n44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad\nbe not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;\n44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with\nus, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs\nof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n\n44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,\nsaying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to\nmy father for ever.\n\n44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the\nlad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\n\n44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?\nlest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.\n\n45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood\nby him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there\nstood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his\nbrethren.\n\n45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh\nheard.\n\n45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father\nyet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were\ntroubled at his presence.\n\n45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.\nAnd they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye\nsold into Egypt.\n\n45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye\nsold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.\n\n45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet\nthere are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor\nharvest.\n\n45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the\nearth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n\n45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath\nmade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith\nthy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,\ntarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou\nshalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's\nchildren, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11\nAnd there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;\nlest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.\n\n45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,\nthat it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\n\n45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all\nthat ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.\n\n45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and\nBenjamin wept upon his neck.\n\n45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and\nafter that his brethren talked with him.\n\n45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,\nJoseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his\nservants.\n\n45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;\nlade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And\ntake your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will\ngive you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of\nthe land.\n\n45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the\nland of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your\nfather, and come.\n\n45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of\nEgypt is your's.\n\n45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,\naccording to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for\nthe way.\n\n45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to\nBenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of\nraiment.\n\n45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden\nwith the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and\nbread and meat for his father by the way.\n\n45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said\nunto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\n\n45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan\nunto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet\nalive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's\nheart fainted, for he believed them not.\n\n45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said\nunto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry\nhim, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,\nIt is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before\nI die.\n\n46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to\nBeersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.\n\n46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,\nJacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\n\n46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down\ninto Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will\ngo down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up\nagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\n\n46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried\nJacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the\nwagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n\n46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had\ngotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his\nseed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his\ndaughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with\nhim into Egypt.\n\n46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\ninto Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.\n\n46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and\nCarmi.\n\n46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,\nand Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n\n46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n\n46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and\nZarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.

And\nthey said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also\nour fathers.\n\n47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we\ncome; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the\nfamine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let\nthy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\n\n47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy\nbrethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in\nthe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the\nland of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity\namong them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\n\n47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before\nPharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n\n47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacob\nsaid unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an\nhundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of\nmy life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the\nlife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n\n47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.\n\n47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a\npossession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land\nof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n\n47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his\nfather's household, with bread, according to their families.\n\n47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very\nsore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by\nreason of the famine.\n\n47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land\nof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:\nand Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\n\n47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\nCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:\nfor why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.\n\n47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your\ncattle, if money fail.\n\n47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them\nbread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle\nof the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all\ntheir cattle for that year.\n\n47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,\nand said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our\nmoney is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not\nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:\n47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?\nbuy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants\nunto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that\nthe land be not desolate.\n\n47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the\nEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over\nthem: so the land became Pharaoh's.\n\n47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of\nthe borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n\n47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had\na portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which\nPharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\n\n47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this\nday and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall\nsow the land.\n\n47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give\nthe fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for\nseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,\nand for food for your little ones.\n\n47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in\nthe sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n\n47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,\nthat Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the\npriests only, which became not Pharaoh's.\n\n47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;\nand they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied\nexceedingly.\n\n47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the\nwhole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.\n\n47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his\nson Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,\nput, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly\nwith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with\nmy fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their\nburyingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\n\n47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel\nbowed himself upon the bed's head.\n\n48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,\nBehold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,\nManasseh and Ephraim.\n\n48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto\nthee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\n\n48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz\nin the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,\nI will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee\na multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee\nfor an everlasting possession.\n\n48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto\nthee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are\nmine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n\n48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,\nand shall be called after the name of their brethren in their\ninheritance.\n\n48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the\nland of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come\nunto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same\nis Bethlehem.\n\n48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9\nAnd Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given\nme in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I\nwill bless them.\n\n48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not\nsee.\n\nAnd he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced\nthem.\n\n48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:\nand, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\n\n48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed\nhimself with his face to the earth.\n\n48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward\nIsrael's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's\nright hand, and brought them near unto him.\n\n48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon\nEphraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's\nhead, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.\n\n48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto\nthis day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the\nlads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of\nthe earth.\n\n48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the\nhead of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,\nto remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.\n\n48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is\nthe firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\n\n48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:\nhe also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly\nhis younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall\nbecome a multitude of nations.\n\n48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel\nbless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set\nEphraim before Manasseh.\n\n48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be\nwith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\n\n48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,\nwhich I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my\nbow.\n\n49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves\ntogether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last\ndays.\n\n49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and\nhearken unto Israel your father.\n\n49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my\nstrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4\nUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to\nthy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.\n\n49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their\nhabitations.\n\n49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,\nmine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,\nand in their selfwill they digged down a wall.\n\n49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it\nwas cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\n\n49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall\nbe in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down\nbefore thee.\n\n49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:\nhe stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall\nrouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a\nlawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall\nthe gathering of the people be.\n\n49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the\nchoice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the\nblood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth\nwhite with milk.\n\n49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for\nan haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.\n\n49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:\n49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was\npleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto\ntribute.\n\n49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.\n\n49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that\nbiteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.\n\n49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.\n\n49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the\nlast.\n\n49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal\ndainties.\n\n49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.\n\n49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;\nwhose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely\ngrieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode\nin strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands\nof the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of\nIsrael:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and\nby the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,\nblessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and\nof the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above\nthe blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the\neverlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the\ncrown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\n\n49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour\nthe prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\n\n49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that\ntheir father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to\nhis blessing he blessed them.\n\n49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered\nunto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the\nfield of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of\nMachpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham\nbought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a\nburyingplace.\n\n49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried\nIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\n\n49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was\nfrom the children of Heth.\n\n49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he\ngathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was\ngathered unto his people.\n\n50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and\nkissed him.\n\n50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his\nfather: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n\n50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the\ndays of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him\nthreescore and ten days.\n\n50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto\nthe house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,\nspeak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made\nme swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in\nthe land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go\nup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n\n50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he\nmade thee swear.\n\n50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all\nthe servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders\nof the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his\nbrethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their\nflocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\n\n50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was\na very great company.\n\n50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond\nJordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:\nand he made a mourning for his father seven days.\n\n50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the\nmourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning\nto the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,\nwhich is beyond Jordan.\n\n50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13\nFor his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in\nthe cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the\nfield for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before\nMamre.\n\n50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all\nthat went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his\nfather.\n\n50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they\nsaid, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us\nall the evil which we did unto him.\n\n50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did\ncommand before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,\nForgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;\nfor they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the\ntrespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept\nwhen they spake unto him.\n\n50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and\nthey said, Behold, we be thy servants.\n\n50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of\nGod?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant\nit unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people\nalive.\n\n50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little\nones.\n\nAnd he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\n\n50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and\nJoseph lived an hundred and ten years.\n\n50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the\nchildren also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon\nJoseph's knees.\n\n50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely\nvisit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware\nto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n\n50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God\nwill surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n\n50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they\nembalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus\n\n\n1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\ninto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.\n\n1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and\nBenjamin, 1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\n\n1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy\nsouls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.\n\n1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\n\n1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased\nabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land\nwas filled with them.\n\n1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\n\n1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of\nIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely\nwith them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there\nfalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight\nagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.\n\n1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with\ntheir burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and\nRaamses.\n\n1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and\ngrew.\n\nAnd they were grieved because of the children of Israel.\n\n1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with\nrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in\nmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all\ntheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.\n\n1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the\nname of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 And\nhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and\nsee them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but\nif it be a daughter, then she shall live.\n\n1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt\ncommanded them, but saved the men children alive.\n\n1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto\nthem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children\nalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew\nwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are\ndelivered ere the midwives come in unto them.\n\n1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people\nmultiplied, and waxed very mighty.\n\n1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he\nmade them houses.\n\n1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is\nborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save\nalive.\n\n2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a\ndaughter of Levi.\n\n2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that\nhe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.\n\n2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of\nbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child\ntherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.\n\n2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.\n\n2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the\nriver; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she\nsaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.\n\n2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the\nbabe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the\nHebrews' children.\n\n2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to\nthee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for\nthee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went\nand called the child's mother.\n\n2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and\nnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took\nthe child, and nursed it.\n\n2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,\nand he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,\nBecause I drew him out of the water.\n\n2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he\nwent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied\nan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.\n\n2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there\nwas no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\n\n2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the\nHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,\nWherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a\nprince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou\nkilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing\nis known.\n\n2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But\nMoses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:\nand he sat down by a well.\n\n2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and\ndrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.\n\n2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up\nand helped them, and watered their flock.\n\n2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that\nye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered\nus out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for\nus, and watered the flock.\n\n2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that\nye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\n\n2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses\nZipporah his daughter.\n\n2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he\nsaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\n\n2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt\ndied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and\nthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.\n\n2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant\nwith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n\n2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect\nunto them.\n\n3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest\nof Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and\ncame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.\n\n3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out\nof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned\nwith fire, and the bush was not consumed.\n\n3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,\nwhy the bush is not burnt.\n\n3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto\nhim out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,\nHere am I.\n\n3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy\nfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\n\n3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he\nwas afraid to look upon God.\n\n3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people\nwhich are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their\ntaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to\ndeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up\nout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing\nwith milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the\nHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and\nthe Jebusites.\n\n3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come\nunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians\noppress them.\n\n3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou\nmayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n\n3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,\nand that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a\ntoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth\nthe people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\n\n3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of\nIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me\nunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say\nunto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,\nThus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me\nunto you.\n\n3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the\nchildren of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is\nmy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\n\n3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,\nThe LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of\nJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen\nthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bring\nyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,\nand the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the\nHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou\nand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say\nunto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us\ngo, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we\nmay sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n\n3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not\nby a mighty hand.\n\n3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my\nwonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will\nlet you go.\n\n3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:\nand it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.\n\n3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that\nsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and\nraiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your\ndaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.\n\n4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe\nme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not\nappeared unto thee.\n\n4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he\nsaid, A rod.\n\n4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,\nand it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.\n\n4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by\nthe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a\nrod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their\nfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,\nhath appeared unto thee.\n\n4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into\nthy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it\nout, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.\n\n4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his\nhand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,\nbehold, it was turned again as his other flesh.\n\n4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither\nhearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the\nvoice of the latter sign.\n\n4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two\nsigns, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the\nwater of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which\nthou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.\n\n4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,\nneither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I\nam slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\n\n4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who\nmaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the\nLORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach\nthee what thou shalt say.\n\n4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him\nwhom thou wilt send.\n\n4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,\nIs not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.\nAnd also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth\nthee, he will be glad in his heart.\n\n4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I\nwill be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye\nshall do.\n\n4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,\neven he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him\ninstead of God.\n\n4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt\ndo signs.\n\n4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said\nunto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which\nare in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to\nMoses, Go in peace.\n\n4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:\nfor all the men are dead which sought thy life.\n\n4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,\nand he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in\nhis hand.\n\n4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into\nEgypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have\nput in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let\nthe people go.\n\n4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is\nmy son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,\nthat he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will\nslay thy son, even thy firstborn.\n\n4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,\nand sought to kill him.\n\n4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her\nson, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art\nthou to me.\n\n4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,\nbecause of the circumcision.\n\n4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\nAnd he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.\n\n4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,\nand all the signs which he had commanded him.\n\n4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of\nthe children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the\nLORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the\npeople.\n\n4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had\nvisited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their\naffliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.\n\n5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus\nsaith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a\nfeast unto me in the wilderness.\n\n5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to\nlet Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\n\n5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,\nwe pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto\nthe LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the\nsword.\n\n5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and\nAaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.\n\n5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and\nye make them rest from their burdens.\n\n5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,\nand their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw\nto make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for\nthemselves.\n\n5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye\nshall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be\nidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.\n\n5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour\ntherein; and let them not regard vain words.\n\n5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,\nand they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not\ngive you straw.\n\n5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your\nwork shall be diminished.\n\n5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of\nEgypt to gather stubble instead of straw.\n\n5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your\ndaily tasks, as when there was straw.\n\n5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's\ntaskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore\nhave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to\nday, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel\ncame and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with\nthy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and\nthey say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but\nthe fault is in thine own people.\n\n5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us\ngo and do sacrifice to the LORD.\n\n5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given\nyou, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.\n\n5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were\nin evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your\nbricks of your daily task.\n\n5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came\nforth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon\nyou, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the\neyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in\ntheir hand to slay us.\n\n5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast\nthou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?\n5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done\nevil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.\n\n6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do\nto Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a\nstrong hand shall he drive them out of his land.\n\n6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3\nAnd I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name\nof God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.\n\n6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them\nthe land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were\nstrangers.\n\n6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom\nthe Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.\n\n6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I\nwill bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will\nrid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched\nout arm, and with great judgments: 6:7 And I will take you to me for a\npeople, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the\nLORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the\nEgyptians.\n\n6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did\nswear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give\nit you for an heritage: I am the LORD.\n\n6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened\nnot unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.\n\n6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak unto\nPharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of\nhis land.\n\n6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of\nIsrael have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who\nam of uncircumcised lips?  6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto\nAaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto\nPharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land\nof Egypt.\n\n6:14 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben\nthe firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these\nbe the families of Reuben.\n\n6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,\nand Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the\nfamilies of Simeon.\n\n6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their\ngenerations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the\nlife of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.\n\n6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their\nfamilies.\n\n6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:\nand the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three\nyears.\n\n6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families\nof Levi according to their generations.\n\n6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she\nbare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an\nhundred and thirty and seven years.\n\n6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.\n\n6:22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.\n\n6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of\nNaashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and\nIthamar.\n\n6:24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these\nare the families of the Korhites.\n\n6:25 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel\nto wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers\nof the Levites according to their families.\n\n6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out\nthe children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their\narmies.\n\n6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out\nthe children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.\n\n6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in\nthe land of Egypt, 6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am\nthe LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto\nthee.\n\n6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised\nlips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  7:1 And the LORD said\nunto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy\nbrother shall be thy prophet.\n\n7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother\nshall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of\nhis land.\n\n7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my\nwonders in the land of Egypt.\n\n7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand\nupon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of\nIsrael, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.\n\n7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch\nforth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from\namong them.\n\n7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.\n\n7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three\nyears old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.\n\n7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 When\nPharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then\nthou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,\nand it shall become a serpent.\n\n7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the\nLORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and\nbefore his servants, and it became a serpent.\n\n7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the\nmagicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their\nenchantments.\n\n7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:\nbut Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.\n\n7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them;\nas the LORD had said.\n\n7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he\nrefuseth to let the people go.\n\n7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the\nwater; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and\nthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.\n\n7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath\nsent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in\nthe wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.\n\n7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:\nbehold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters\nwhich are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\n\n7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall\nstink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the\nriver.\n\n7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and\nstretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,\nupon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of\nwater, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood\nthroughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in\nvessels of stone.\n\n7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted\nup the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight\nof Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that\nwere in the river were turned to blood.\n\n7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and\nthe Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was\nblood throughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and\nPharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the\nLORD had said.\n\n7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set\nhis heart to this also.\n\n7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to\ndrink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n\n7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten\nthe river.\n\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,\nThus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy\nborders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs\nabundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy\nbedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and\nupon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:\n8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and\nupon all thy servants.\n\n8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine\nhand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the\nponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.\n\n8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the\nfrogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.\n\n8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up\nfrogs upon the land of Egypt.\n\n8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the\nLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and\nI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.\n\n8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat\nfor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the\nfrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river\nonly?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to\nthy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD\nour God.\n\n8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and\nfrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river\nonly.\n\n8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto\nthe LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.\n\n8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs\ndied out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.\n\n8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.\n\n8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his\nheart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.\n\n8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy\nrod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,\nand smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in\nbeast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of\nEgypt.\n\n8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth\nlice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.\n\n8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:\nand Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as\nthe LORD had said.\n\n8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\nstand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto\nhim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send\nswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,\nand into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of\nswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.\n\n8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my\npeople dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou\nmayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.\n\n8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to\nmorrow shall this sign be.\n\n8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies\ninto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all\nthe land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of\nflies.\n\n8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,\nsacrifice to your God in the land.\n\n8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice\nthe abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we\nsacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will\nthey not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days' journey into the\nwilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.\n\n8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the\nLORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:\nintreat for me.\n\n8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat\nthe LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his\nservants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal\ndeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the\nLORD.\n\n8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\n\n8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed\nthe swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his\npeople; there remained not one.\n\n8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would\nhe let the people go.\n\n9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,\nThus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they\nmay serve me.\n\n9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3\nBehold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,\nupon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and\nupon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.\n\n9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the\ncattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the\nchildren's of Israel.\n\n9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD\nshall do this thing in the land.\n\n9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of\nEgypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.\n\n9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of\nthe Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did\nnot let the people go.\n\n9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls\nof ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven\nin the sight of Pharaoh.\n\n9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall\nbe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and\nMoses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking\nforth with blains upon man, and upon beast.\n\n9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the\nboils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the\nEgyptians.\n\n9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not\nunto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.\n\n9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\nstand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the\nHebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and\nupon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that\nthere is none like me in all the earth.\n\n9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy\npeople with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.\n\n9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to\nshew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all\nthe earth.\n\n9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt\nnot let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause\nit to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since\nthe foundation thereof even until now.\n\n9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast\nin the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the\nfield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon\nthem, and they shall die.\n\n9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh\nmade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he\nthat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his\ncattle in the field.\n\n9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward\nheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and\nupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of\nEgypt.\n\n9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD\nsent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the\nLORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.\n\n9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,\nsuch as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it\nbecame a nation.\n\n9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was\nin the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the\nfield, and brake every tree of the field.\n\n9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,\nwas there no hail.\n\n9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto\nthem, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my\npeople are wicked.\n\n9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty\nthunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no\nlonger.\n\n9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I\nwill spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall\ncease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how\nthat the earth is the LORD's.\n\n9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet\nfear the LORD God.\n\n9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in\nthe ear, and the flax was bolled.\n\n9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not\ngrown up.\n\n9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad\nhis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the\nrain was not poured upon the earth.\n\n9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders\nwere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his\nservants.\n\n9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the\nchildren of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\n\n10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have\nhardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew\nthese my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears\nof thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,\nand my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I\nam the LORD.\n\n10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus\nsaith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble\nthyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will\nI bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the face\nof the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall\neat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you\nfrom the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of\nthe field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all\nthy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy\nfathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they\nwere upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out\nfrom Pharaoh.\n\n10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be\na snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their\nGod: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses and\nAaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,\nserve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 And\nMoses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons\nand with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;\nfor we must hold a feast unto the LORD.\n\n10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will\nlet you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.\n\n10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye\ndid desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.\n\n10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\nland of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of\nEgypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath\nleft.\n\n10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and\nthe LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that\nnight; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.\n\n10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in\nall the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there\nwere no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.\n\n10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land\nwas darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the\nfruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any\ngreen thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all\nthe land of Egypt.\n\n10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I\nhave sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.\n\n10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and\nintreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death\nonly.\n\n10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\n\n10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away\nthe locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one\nlocust in all the coasts of Egypt.\n\n10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let\nthe children of Israel go.\n\n10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward\nheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even\ndarkness which may be felt.\n\n10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was\na thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They saw\nnot one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but\nall the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n\n10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;\nonly let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones\nalso go with you.\n\n10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt\nofferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.\n\n10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be\nleft behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and\nwe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.\n\n10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them\ngo.\n\n10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to\nthyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou\nshalt die.\n\n10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again\nno more.\n\n11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more\nupon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:\nwhen he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence\naltogether.\n\n11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of\nhis neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and\njewels of gold.\n\n11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the\nEgyptians.\n\nMoreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the\nsight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.\n\n11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out\ninto the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of\nEgypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his\nthrone, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the\nmill; and all the firstborn of beasts.\n\n11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,\nsuch as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.\n\n11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move\nhis tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD\ndoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n\n11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down\nthemselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that\nfollow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from\nPharaoh in a great anger.\n\n11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;\nthat my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\n\n11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and\nthe LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the\nchildren of Israel go out of his land.\n\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt\nsaying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it\nshall be the first month of the year to you.\n\n12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the\ntenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,\naccording to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 And\nif the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour\nnext unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;\nevery man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.\n\n12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye\nshall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shall\nkeep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole\nassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.\n\n12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side\nposts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat\nit.\n\n12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and\nunleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\n\n12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with\nfire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.\n\n12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and\nthat which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.\n\n12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on\nyour feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:\nit is the LORD's passover.\n\n12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will\nsmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and\nagainst all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.\n\n12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where\nye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague\nshall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.\n\n12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep\nit a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a\nfeast by an ordinance for ever.\n\n12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye\nshall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth\nleavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul\nshall be cut off from Israel.\n\n12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in\nthe seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner\nof work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,\nthat only may be done of you.\n\n12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this\nselfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:\ntherefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an\nordinance for ever.\n\n12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,\nye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the\nmonth at even.\n\n12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for\nwhosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut\noff from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born\nin the land.\n\n12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye\neat unleavened bread.\n\n12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto\nthem, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and\nkill the passover.\n\n12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood\nthat is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts\nwith the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at\nthe door of his house until the morning.\n\n12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when\nhe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the\nLORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to\ncome in unto your houses to smite you.\n\n12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to\nthy sons for ever.\n\n12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the\nLORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep\nthis service.\n\n12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto\nyou, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is the\nsacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the\nchildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and\ndelivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.\n\n12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had\ncommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n\n12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the\nfirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat\non his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the\ndungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\n\n12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and\nall the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was\nnot a house where there was not one dead.\n\n12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,\nand get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of\nIsrael; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.\n\n12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be\ngone; and bless me also.\n\n12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might\nsend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.\n\n12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their\nkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.\n\n12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;\nand they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of\ngold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the\nsight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as\nthey required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.\n\n12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,\nabout six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.\n\n12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and\nherds, even very much cattle.\n\n12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought\nforth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust\nout of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for\nthemselves any victual.\n\n12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in\nEgypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\n\n12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty\nyears, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of\nthe LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\n\n12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing\nthem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be\nobserved of all the children of Israel in their generations.\n\n12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of\nthe passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But every\nman's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised\nhim, then shall he eat thereof.\n\n12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.\n\n12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought\nof the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone\nthereof.\n\n12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\n\n12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the\npassover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let\nhim come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the\nland: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.\n\n12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger\nthat sojourneth among you.\n\n12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses\nand Aaron, so did they.\n\n12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring\nthe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all\nthe firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of\nIsrael, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\n\n13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye\ncame out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of\nhand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened\nbread be eaten.\n\n13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.\n\n13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\nthe Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,\nand the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a\nland flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in\nthis month.\n\n13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh\nday shall be a feast to the LORD.\n\n13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no\nleavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen\nwith thee in all thy quarters.\n\n13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done\nbecause of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of\nEgypt.\n\n13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a\nmemorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth:\nfor with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.\n\n13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year\nto year.\n\n13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\nthe Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall\ngive it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that\nopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which\nthou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.\n\n13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and\nif thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all\nthe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.\n\n13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,\nsaying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of\nhand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:\n13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that\nthe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the\nfirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to\nthe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the\nfirstborn of my children I redeem.\n\n13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets\nbetween thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth\nout of Egypt.\n\n13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that\nGod led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,\nalthough that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people\nrepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God led\nthe people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:\nand the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.\n\n13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly\nsworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and\nye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.\n\n13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,\nin the edge of the wilderness.\n\n13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to\nlead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them\nlight; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of\nthe cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the\npeople.\n\n14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,\nbetween Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall\nye encamp by the sea.\n\n14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are\nentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\n\n14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after\nthem; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that\nthe Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.\n\n14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the\nheart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,\nand they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from\nserving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people\nwith him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the\nchariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\n\n14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he\npursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went\nout with an high hand.\n\n14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots\nof Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them\nencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.\n\n14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up\ntheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they\nwere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.\n\n14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,\nhast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou\ndealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this\nthe word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we\nmay serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the\nEgyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\n\n14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and\nsee the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for\nthe Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no\nmore for ever.\n\n14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.\n\n14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?\nspeak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 But\nlift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and\ndivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through\nthe midst of the sea.\n\n14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and\nthey shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and\nupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n\n14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have\ngotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his\nhorsemen.\n\n14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,\nremoved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from\nbefore their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between\nthe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud\nand darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the\none came not near the other all the night.\n\n14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD\ncaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and\nmade the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n\n14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon\nthe dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right\nhand, and on their left.\n\n14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst\nof the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n\n14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked\nunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the\ncloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took off\ntheir chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the\nEgyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD\nfighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n\n14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\nsea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their\nchariots, and upon their horsemen.\n\n14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea\nreturned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians\nfled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of\nthe sea.\n\n14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the\nhorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after\nthem; there remained not so much as one of them.\n\n14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of\nthe sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and\non their left.\n\n14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the\nEgyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.\n\n14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the\nEgyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and\nhis servant Moses.\n\n15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the\nLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath\ntriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea.\n\n15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:\nhe is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,\nand I will exalt him.\n\n15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.\n\n15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his\nchosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.\n\n15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a\nstone.\n\n15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right\nhand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\n\n15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown\nthem that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which\nconsumed them as stubble.\n\n15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered\ntogether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were\ncongealed in the heart of the sea.\n\n15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the\nspoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my\nhand shall destroy them.\n\n15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank\nas lead in the mighty waters.\n\n15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,\nglorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou\nstretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.\n\n15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast\nredeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy\nhabitation.\n\n15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on\nthe inhabitants of Palestina.\n\n15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,\ntrembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan\nshall melt away.\n\n15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine\narm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O\nLORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.\n\n15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of\nthine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee\nto dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have\nestablished.\n\n15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.\n\n15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his\nhorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the\nsea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the\nmidst of the sea.\n\n15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel\nin her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and\nwith dances.\n\n15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath\ntriumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea.\n\n15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into\nthe wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,\nand found no water.\n\n15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters\nof Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called\nMarah.\n\n15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we\ndrink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a\ntree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made\nsweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he\nproved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the\nvoice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his\nsight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his\nstatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have\nbrought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.\n\n15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and\nthreescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\n\n16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation\nof the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is\nbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after\ntheir departing out of the land of Egypt.\n\n16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured\nagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children of\nIsrael said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the\nLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we\ndid eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this\nwilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\n\n16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from\nheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate\nevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or\nno.\n\n16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall\nprepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as\nthey gather daily.\n\n16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At\neven, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the\nland of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of\nthe LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and\nwhat are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, This\nshall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,\nand in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your\nmurmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your\nmurmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.\n\n16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the\nchildren of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your\nmurmurings.\n\n16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation\nof the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,\nand, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.\n\n16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the\nmurmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even\nye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;\nand ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.\n\n16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and\ncovered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.\n\n16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of\nthe wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar\nfrost on the ground.\n\n16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to\nanother, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said\nunto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.\n\n16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it\nevery man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to\nthe number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in\nhis tents.\n\n16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some\nless.\n\n16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much\nhad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they\ngathered every man according to his eating.\n\n16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\n\n16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them\nleft of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses\nwas wroth with them.\n\n16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his\neating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.\n\n16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice\nas much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the\ncongregation came and told Moses.\n\n16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To\nmorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which\nye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which\nremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\n\n16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did\nnot stink, neither was there any worm therein.\n\n16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto\nthe LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.\n\n16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is\nthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n\n16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on\nthe seventh day for to gather, and they found none.\n\n16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my\ncommandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you\nthe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two\ndays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place\non the seventh day.\n\n16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.\n\n16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it\nwas like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers\nmade with honey.\n\n16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,\nFill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see\nthe bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought\nyou forth from the land of Egypt.\n\n16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of\nmanna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your\ngenerations.\n\n16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the\nTestimony, to be kept.\n\n16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they\ncame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the\nborders of the land of Canaan.\n\n16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.\n\n17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from\nthe wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the\ncommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no\nwater for the people to drink.\n\n17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us\nwater that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with\nme? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirsted\nthere for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,\nWherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill\nus and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses cried\nunto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be\nalmost ready to stone me.\n\n17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take\nwith thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest\nthe river, take in thine hand, and go.\n\n17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;\nand thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,\nthat the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders\nof Israel.\n\n17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because\nof the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the\nLORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,\nand fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n\n17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight\nwith Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the\nrod of God in mine hand.\n\n17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:\nand Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n\n17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel\nprevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n\n17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it\nunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,\nthe one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his\nhands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n\n17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of\nthe sword.\n\n17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a\nbook, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put\nout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\n\n17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it\nJehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the\nLORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\n\n18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of\nall that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that\nthe LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses'\nfather in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,\n18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for\nhe said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name of\nthe other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine\nhelp, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,\nMoses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into\nthe wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And he\nsaid unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy\nwife, and her two sons with her.\n\n18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,\nand kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they\ncame into the tent.\n\n18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto\nPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail\nthat had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.\n\n18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done\nto Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n\n18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out\nof the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath\ndelivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n\n18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the\nthing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.\n\n18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and\nsacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to\neat bread with Moses' father in law before God.\n\n18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the\npeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the\nevening.\n\n18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people,\nhe said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest\nthou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto\neven?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people\ncome unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they\ncome unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them\nknow the statutes of God, and his laws.\n\n18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou\ndoest is not good.\n\n18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is\nwith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to\nperform it thyself alone.\n\n18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God\nshall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou\nmayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach them\nordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must\nwalk, and the work that they must do.\n\n18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such\nas fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over\nthem, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of\nfifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people at\nall seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring\nunto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be\neasier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.\n\n18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou\nshalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their\nplace in peace.\n\n18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did\nall that he had said.\n\n18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads\nover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of\nfifties, and rulers of tens.\n\n18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they\nbrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n\n18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into\nhis own land.\n\n19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth\nout of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness\nof Sinai.\n\n19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert\nof Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped\nbefore the mount.\n\n19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of\nthe mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and\ntell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the\nEgyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto\nmyself.\n\n19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my\ncovenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all\npeople: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a\nkingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\n\nThese are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of\nIsrael.\n\n19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid\nbefore their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.\n\n19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD\nhath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people\nunto the LORD.\n\n19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick\ncloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe\nthee for ever.\n\nAnd Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.\n\n19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify\nthem to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 And\nbe ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come\ndown in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.\n\n19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,\nTake heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch\nthe border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to\ndeath: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be\nstoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not\nlive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\n\n19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and\nsanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.\n\n19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:\ncome not at your wives.\n\n19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there\nwere thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and\nthe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that\nwas in the camp trembled.\n\n19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with\nGod; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.\n\n19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD\ndescended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke\nof a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\n\n19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder\nand louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\n\n19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the\nmount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses\nwent up.\n\n19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest\nthey break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.\n\n19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify\nthemselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.\n\n19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount\nSinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and\nsanctify it.\n\n19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt\ncome up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the\npeople break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth\nupon them.\n\n19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.\n\n20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy\nGod, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the\nhouse of bondage.\n\n20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n\n20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness\nof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,\nor that is in the water under the earth.\n\n20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I\nthe LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the\nfathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them\nthat hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love\nme, and keep my commandments.\n\n20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the\nLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n\n20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n\n20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the\nseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not\ndo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor\nthy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy\ngates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,\nand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the\nLORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\n\n20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon\nthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n\n20:13 Thou shalt not kill.\n\n20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n\n20:15 Thou shalt not steal.\n\n20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\n\n20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet\nthy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his\nox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\n\n20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and\nthe noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the\npeople saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.\n\n20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:\nbut let not God speak with us, lest we die.\n\n20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to\nprove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin\nnot.\n\n20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the\nthick darkness where God was.\n\n20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the\nchildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from\nheaven.\n\n20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make\nunto you gods of gold.\n\n20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice\nthereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and\nthine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto\nthee, and I will bless thee.\n\n20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build\nit of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast\npolluted it.\n\n20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy\nnakedness be not discovered thereon.\n\n21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.\n\n21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in\nthe seventh he shall go out free for nothing.\n\n21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were\nmarried, then his wife shall go out with him.\n\n21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons\nor daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he\nshall go out by himself.\n\n21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,\nand my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shall\nbring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or\nunto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an\naul; and he shall serve him for ever.\n\n21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not\ngo out as the menservants do.\n\n21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,\nthen shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation\nhe shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.\n\n21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her\nafter the manner of daughters.\n\n21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty\nof marriage, shall he not diminish.\n\n21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out\nfree without money.\n\n21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to\ndeath.\n\n21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;\nthen I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.\n\n21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him\nwith guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.\n\n21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely\nput to death.\n\n21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found\nin his hand, he shall surely be put to death.\n\n21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be\nput to death.\n\n21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,\nor with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If he\nrise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote\nhim be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall\ncause him to be thoroughly healed.\n\n21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he\ndie under his hand; he shall be surely punished.\n\n21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be\npunished: for he is his money.\n\n21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit\ndepart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely\npunished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he\nshall pay as the judges determine.\n\n21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,\n21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\n21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n\n21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his\nmaid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.\n\n21:27 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's\ntooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.\n\n21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall\nbe surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of\nthe ox shall be quit.\n\n21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and\nit hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but\nthat he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his\nowner also shall be put to death.\n\n21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for\nthe ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.\n\n21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according\nto this judgment shall it be done unto him.\n\n21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall\ngive unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be\nstoned.\n\n21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and\nnot cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 21:34 The owner of the\npit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the\ndead beast shall be his.\n\n21:35 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall\nsell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also\nthey shall divide.\n\n21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,\nand his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and\nthe dead shall be his own.\n\n22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;\nhe shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.\n\n22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,\nthere shall no blood be shed for him.\n\n22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him;\nfor he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall\nbe sold for his theft.\n\n22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be\nox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.\n\n22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall\nput in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best\nof his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make\nrestitution.\n\n22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of\ncorn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he\nthat kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.\n\n22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep,\nand it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let\nhim pay double.\n\n22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be\nbrought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his\nneighbour's goods.\n\n22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for\nsheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another\nchallengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the\njudges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto\nhis neighbour.\n\n22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a\nsheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,\nno man seeing it: 22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them\nboth, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and\nthe owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.\n\n22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the\nowner thereof.\n\n22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and\nhe shall not make good that which was torn.\n\n22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or\ndie, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it\ngood.\n\n22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good:\nif it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.\n\n22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with\nher, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.\n\n22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay\nmoney according to the dowry of virgins.\n\n22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\n\n22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.\n\n22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he\nshall be utterly destroyed.\n\n22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were\nstrangers in the land of Egypt.\n\n22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.\n\n22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I\nwill surely hear their cry; 22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I\nwill kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your\nchildren fatherless.\n\n22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,\nthou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him\nusury.\n\n22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou\nshalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 22:27 For that\nis his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he\nsleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will\nhear;

on the eighth day thou shalt give\nit me.\n\n22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh\nthat is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.\n\n23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the\nwicked to be an unrighteous witness.\n\n23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou\nspeak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 23:3 Neither\nshalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.\n\n23:4 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt\nsurely bring it back to him again.\n\n23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his\nburden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with\nhim.\n\n23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.\n\n23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous\nslay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.\n\n23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and\nperverteth the words of the righteous.\n\n23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of\na stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n\n23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the\nfruits thereof: 23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and\nlie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave\nthe beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with\nthy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.\n\n23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou\nshalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy\nhandmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.\n\n23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and\nmake no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out\nof thy mouth.\n\n23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.\n\n23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat\nunleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time\nappointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and\nnone shall appear before me empty:) 23:16 And the feast of harvest,\nthe firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and\nthe feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou\nhast gathered in thy labours out of the field.\n\n23:17 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the\nLORD God.\n\n23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened\nbread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.\n\n23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\nmother's milk.\n\n23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,\nand to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.\n\n23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will\nnot pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.\n\n23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I\nspeak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary\nunto thine adversaries.\n\n23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the\nAmorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,\nthe Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.\n\n23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do\nafter their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite\nbreak down their images.\n\n23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy\nbread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of\nthee.\n\n23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy\nland: the number of thy days I will fulfil.\n\n23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people\nto whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their\nbacks unto thee.\n\n23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the\nHivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.\n\n23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the\nland become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against\nthee.\n\n23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,\nuntil thou be increased, and inherit the land.\n\n23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of\nthe Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will\ndeliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;

and shalt wave them for\na wave offering before the LORD.\n\n29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon\nthe altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it\nis an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's\nconsecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it\nshall be thy part.\n\n29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the\nshoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved\nup, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,\nand of that which is for his sons: 29:28 And it shall be Aaron's and\nhis sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is\nan heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children\nof Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave\noffering unto the LORD.\n\n29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to\nbe anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.\n\n29:30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven\ndays, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to\nminister in the holy place.\n\n29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his\nflesh in the holy place.\n\n29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the\nbread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was\nmade, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat\nthereof, because they are holy.\n\n29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,\nremain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:\nit shall not be eaten, because it is holy.\n\n29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to\nall things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou\nconsecrate them.\n\n29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for\natonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an\natonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.\n\n29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and\nsanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth\nthe altar shall be holy.\n\n29:38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two\nlambs of the first year day by day continually.\n\n29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb\nthou shalt offer at even: 29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of\nflour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the\nfourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.\n\n29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do\nthereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according\nto the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by\nfire unto the LORD.\n\n29:42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your\ngenerations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before\nthe LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.\n\n29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the\ntabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.\n\n29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the\naltar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me\nin the priest's office.\n\n29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their\nGod.\n\n29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought\nthem forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am\nthe LORD their God.\n\n30:1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim\nwood shalt thou make it.\n\n30:2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth\nthereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height\nthereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.\n\n30:3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and\nthe sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt\nmake unto it a crown of gold round about.\n\n30:4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it,\nby the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make\nit; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.\n\n30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them\nwith gold.\n\n30:6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the\ntestimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I\nwill meet with thee.\n\n30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he\ndresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.\n\n30:8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense\nupon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your\ngenerations.\n\n30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice,\nnor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.\n\n30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a\nyear with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the\nyear shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it\nis most holy unto the LORD.\n\n30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:12 When thou takest\nthe sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they\ngive every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou\nnumberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou\nnumberest them.\n\n30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are\nnumbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel\nis twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.\n\n30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty\nyears old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.\n\n30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less\nthan half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make\nan atonement for your souls.\n\n30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of\nIsrael, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel\nbefore the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.\n\n30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt also\nmake a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and\nthou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the\naltar, and thou shalt put water therein.\n\n30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet\nthereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,\nthey shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near\nto the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:\n30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die\nnot: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to\nhis seed throughout their generations.\n\n30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also\nunto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of\nsweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and\nof sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassia\nfive hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil\nolive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an\nointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy\nanointing oil.\n\n30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation\ntherewith, and the ark of the testimony, 30:27 And the table and all\nhis vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of\nincense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,\nand the laver and his foot.\n\n30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:\nwhatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.\n\n30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,\nthat they may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\n30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This\nshall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.\n\n30:32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make\nany other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it\nshall be holy unto you.\n\n30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of\nit upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.\n\n30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,\nstacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure\nfrankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thou\nshalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,\ntempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it\nvery small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of\nthe congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you\nmost holy.\n\n30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make\nto yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto\nthee holy for the LORD.\n\n30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall\neven be cut off from his people.\n\n31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called by\nname Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:\n31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in\nunderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,\n31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in\nbrass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of\ntimber, to work in all manner of workmanship.\n\n31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of\nAhisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise\nhearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have\ncommanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark\nof the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the\nfurniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, and\nthe pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,\n31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the\nlaver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy\ngarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to\nminister in the priest's office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, and\nsweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have\ncommanded thee shall they do.\n\n31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou also\nunto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:\nfor it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that\nye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.\n\n31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:\nevery one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever\ndoeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his\npeople.\n\n31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of\nrest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,\nhe shall surely be put to death.\n\n31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to\nobserve the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant.\n\n31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for\nin six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he\nrested, and was refreshed.\n\n31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing\nwith him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,\nwritten with the finger of God.\n\n32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of\nthe mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and\nsaid unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for\nthis Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we\nwot not what is become of him.\n\n32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which\nare in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,\nand bring them unto me.\n\n32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in\ntheir ears, and brought them unto Aaron.\n\n32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a\ngraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These\nbe thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\n\n32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron\nmade proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.\n\n32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt\nofferings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat\nand to drink, and rose up to play.\n\n32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,\nwhich thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted\nthemselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I\ncommanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped\nit, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O\nIsrael, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\n\n32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,\nbehold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,\nthat my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:\nand I will make of thee a great nation.\n\n32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth\nthy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth\nout of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?\n32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did\nhe bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them\nfrom the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of\nthis evil against thy people.\n\n32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou\nswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your\nseed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of\nwill I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.\n\n32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto\nhis people.\n\n32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two\ntables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on\nboth their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.\n\n32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the\nwriting of God, graven upon the tables.\n\n32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,\nhe said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.\n\n32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,\nneither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the\nnoise of them that sing do I hear.\n\n32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that\nhe saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he\ncast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.\n\n32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the\nfire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made\nthe children of Israel drink of it.\n\n32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that\nthou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let\nnot the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they\nare set on mischief.\n\n32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:\nfor as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of\nEgypt, we wot not what is become of him.\n\n32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it\noff. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came\nout this calf.\n\n32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had\nmade them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 Then\nMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's\nside? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered\nthemselves together unto him.\n\n32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put\nevery man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate\nthroughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his\ncompanion, and every man his neighbour.\n\n32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and\nthere fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\n\n32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,\neven every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow\nupon you a blessing this day.\n\n32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the\npeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the\nLORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.\n\n32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have\nsinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.\n\n32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,\nI pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.\n\n32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,\nhim will I blot out of my book.\n\n32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have\nspoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:\nnevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.\n\n32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,\nwhich Aaron made.\n\n33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and\nthe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto\nthe land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,\nUnto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel before\nthee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the\nHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a\nland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of\nthee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the\nway.\n\n33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and\nno man did put on him his ornaments.\n\n33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of\nIsrael, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of\nthee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy\nornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.\n\n33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments\nby the mount Horeb.\n\n33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,\nafar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the\ncongregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the\nLORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was\nwithout the camp.\n\n33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,\nthat all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and\nlooked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.\n\n33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the\ncloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and\nthe Lord talked with Moses.\n\n33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle\ndoor: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent\ndoor.\n\n33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh\nunto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant\nJoshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the\ntabernacle.\n\n33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up\nthis people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with\nme. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found\ngrace in my sight.\n\n33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,\nshew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in\nthy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.\n\n33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give\nthee rest.\n\n33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us\nnot up hence.\n\n33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have\nfound grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so\nshall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are\nupon the face of the earth.\n\n33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that\nthou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know\nthee by name.\n\n33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.\n\n33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I\nwill proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious\nto whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew\nmercy.\n\n33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man\nsee me, and live.\n\n33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou\nshalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my\nglory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and\nwill cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will take\naway mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall\nnot be seen.\n\n34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like\nunto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were\nin the first tables, which thou brakest.\n\n34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto\nmount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.\n\n34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen\nthroughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before\nthat mount.\n\n34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses\nrose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the\nLORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.\n\n34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,\nand proclaimed the name of the LORD.\n\n34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The\nLORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in\ngoodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving\niniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear\nthe guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,\nand upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth\ngeneration.\n\n34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and\nworshipped.\n\n34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let\nmy LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and\npardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.\n\n34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I\nwill do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in\nany nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work\nof the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.\n\n34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive\nout before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and\nthe Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n\n34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the\ninhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in\nthe midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break\ntheir images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worship\nno other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:\n34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and\nthey go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,\nand one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou take\nof their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring\nafter their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.\n\n34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\n\n34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou\nshalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the\nmonth Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.\n\n34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among\nthy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.\n\n34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and\nif thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the\nfirstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before\nme empty.\n\n34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt\nrest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n\n34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of\nwheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.\n\n34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the\nLORD God, the God of Israel.\n\n34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy\nborders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up\nto appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.\n\n34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;\nneither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto\nthe morning.\n\n34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\nmother's milk.\n\n34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after\nthe tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with\nIsrael.\n\n34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he\ndid neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables\nthe words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\n\n34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with\nthe two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the\nmount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he\ntalked with him.\n\n34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,\nthe skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.\n\n34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the\ncongregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.\n\n34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave\nthem in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount\nSinai.\n\n34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his\nface.\n\n34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he\ntook the vail off, until he came out.

35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in\nwisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of\nworkmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and\nin silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set\nthem, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.\n\n35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and\nAholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n\n35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of\nwork, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the\nembroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,\nand of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that\ndevise cunning work.\n\n36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in\nwhom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all\nmanner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that\nthe LORD had commanded.\n\n36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted\nman, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose\nheart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And they\nreceived of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had\nbrought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it\nwithal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.\n\n36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,\ncame every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake unto\nMoses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service\nof the work, which the LORD commanded to make.\n\n36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more\nwork for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained\nfrom bringing.\n\n36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make\nit, and too much.\n\n36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of\nthe tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and\npurple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.\n\n36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the\nbreadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.\n\n36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other\nfive curtains he coupled one unto another.\n\n36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the\nselvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of\nanother curtain, in the coupling of the second.\n\n36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in\nthe edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the\nloops held one curtain to another.\n\n36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one\nunto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.\n\n36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the\ntabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.\n\n36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was\nthe breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.\n\n36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by\nthemselves.\n\n36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain\nin the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain\nwhich coupleth the second.\n\n36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,\nthat it might be one.\n\n36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and\na covering of badgers' skins above that.\n\n36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing\nup.\n\n36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board\none cubit and a half.\n\n36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus\ndid he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.\n\n36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle;

that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\n40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15\nAnd thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that\nthey may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing\nshall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their\ngenerations.\n\n40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so\ndid he.\n\n40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on\nthe first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.\n\n40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,\nand set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared\nup his pillars.\n\n40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the\ncovering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the\nstaves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21\nAnd he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the\ncovering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded\nMoses.\n\n40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the\nside of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.\n\n40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the\nLORD had commanded Moses.\n\n40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over\nagainst the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.\n\n40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded\nMoses.\n\n40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation\nbefore the vail: 40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.\n\n40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the\ntabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the\nburnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and\nthe altar, and put water there, to wash withal.\n\n40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their\nfeet thereat: 40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation,\nand when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the\naltar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the\nwork.\n\n40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory\nof the LORD filled the tabernacle.\n\n40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the\ncongregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the\nLORD filled the tabernacle.\n\n40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the\nchildren of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if the\ncloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it\nwas taken up.\n\n40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and\nfire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,\nthroughout all their journeys.\n\n\n\n\nThe Third Book of Moses:  Called Leviticus\n\n\n1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the\ntabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children of\nIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto\nthe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the\nherd, and of the flock.\n\n1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a\nmale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at\nthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.\n\n1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and\nit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.\n\n1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,\nAaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round\nabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.\n\n1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,\nand lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron's\nsons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the\nwood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards\nand his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on\nthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of\nthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without\nblemish.\n\n1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before\nthe LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood\nround about upon the altar.\n\n1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:\nand the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire\nwhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the\nlegs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon\nthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of\nfowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young\npigeons.\n\n1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his\nhead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung\nout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop\nwith his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by\nthe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings\nthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it\nupon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt\nsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n2:1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his\noffering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and\nput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons\nthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour\nthereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;\nand the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an\noffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And the\nremnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a\nthing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\n\n2:4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the\noven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil.\n\n2:5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be\nof fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.\n\n2:6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat\noffering.\n\n2:7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it\nshall be made of fine flour with oil.\n\n2:8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these\nthings unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he\nshall bring it unto the altar.\n\n2:9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial\nthereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by\nfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n2:10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and\nhis sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made\nby fire.\n\n2:11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be\nmade with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any\noffering of the LORD made by fire.\n\n2:12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto\nthe LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.\n\n2:13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with\nsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to\nbe lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt\noffer salt.\n\n2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the\nLORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green\nears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.\n\n2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it\nis a meat offering.\n\n2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten\ncorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense\nthereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n3:1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer\nit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it\nwithout blemish before the LORD.\n\n3:2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill\nit at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons\nthe priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.\n\n3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD;

then let him bring\nfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish\nunto the LORD for a sin offering.\n\n4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of\nthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the\nbullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.\n\n4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,\nand bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priest\nshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven\ntimes before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.\n\n4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the\naltar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of\nthe congregation;

the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that\nis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon\nthem, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the\nkidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from the\nbullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn\nthem upon the altar of the burnt offering.\n\n4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,\nand with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the whole\nbullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,\nwhere the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:\nwhere the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.\n\n4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,\nand the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done\nsomewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things\nwhich should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, which\nthey have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall\noffer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle\nof the congregation.\n\n4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the\nhead of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed\nbefore the LORD.\n\n4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's\nblood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shall\ndip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times\nbefore the LORD, even before the vail.\n\n4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar\nwhich is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the\naltar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of\nthe congregation.\n\n4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the\naltar.\n\n4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a\nsin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an\natonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.\n\n4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn\nhim as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the\ncongregation.\n\n4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance\nagainst any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things\nwhich should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, wherein\nhe hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a\nkid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay his\nhand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they\nkill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.\n\n4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with\nhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,\nand shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt\noffering.\n\n4:26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the\nsacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement\nfor him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n4:27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while\nhe doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD\nconcerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

and the\npriest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made\nby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his\nsin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a\nwitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,\nthen he shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of\nan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of\nunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall\nbe unclean, and guilty.\n\n5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it\nbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he\nknoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.\n\n5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do\ngood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it\nbe hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one\nof these.\n\n5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,\nthat he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And he\nshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he\nhath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,\nfor a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him\nconcerning his sin.\n\n5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his\ntrespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a\nburnt offering.\n\n5:8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that\nwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his\nneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle of\nthe blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar;

he shall put no oil\nupon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a\nsin offering.\n\n5:12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take\nhis handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,\naccording to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin\noffering.\n\n5:13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his\nsin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:\nand the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.\n\n5:14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit a\ntrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;\nthen he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without\nblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.\n\n5:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the\nholy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the\npriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of\nthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are\nforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist\nit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with\nthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance\nwherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against\nthe LORD.\n\n6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, and\ncommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that\nwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken\naway by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have found\nthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in\nany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shall\nbe, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that\nwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully\ngotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing\nwhich he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he\nshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part\nmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day\nof his trespass offering.\n\n6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram\nwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass\noffering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonement\nfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of\nall that he hath done in trespassing therein.\n\n6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and his\nsons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt\noffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the\nmorning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.\n\n6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen\nbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the\nfire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall\nput them beside the altar.\n\n6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and\ncarry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.\n\n6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not\nbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and\nlay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the\nfat of the peace offerings.\n\n6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go\nout.\n\n6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall\noffer it before the LORD, before the altar.\n\n6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat\noffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is\nupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet\nsavour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.\n\n6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with\nunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.\n\n6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for\ntheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the\nsin offering, and as the trespass offering.\n\n6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It\nshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the\nofferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall\nbe holy.\n\n6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering\nof Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the\nday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for\na meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof\nat night.\n\n6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou\nshalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt\nthou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall\noffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly\nburnt.\n\n6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it\nshall not be eaten.\n\n6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and\nto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place\nwhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed\nbefore the LORD: it is most holy.\n\n6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy\nplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when\nthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt\nwash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.\n\n6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and\nif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed\nin water.\n\n6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most\nholy.\n\n6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the\ntabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,\nshall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most\nholy.\n\n7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill\nthe trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round\nabout upon the altar.\n\n7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the\nfat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat\nthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above\nthe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priest\nshall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the\nLORD: it is a trespass offering.\n\n7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten\nin the holy place: it is most holy.\n\n7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one\nlaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have\nit.\n\n7:8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the\npriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he\nhath offered.\n\n7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that\nis dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's\nthat offereth it.\n\n7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the\nsons of Aaron have, one as much as another.\n\n7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he\nshall offer unto the LORD.\n\n7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the\nsacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of\nfine flour, fried.\n\n7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread\nwith the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.\n\n7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an\nheave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that\nsprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.\n\n7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for\nthanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall\nnot leave any of it until the morning.\n\n7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary\noffering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his\nsacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:\n7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day\nshall be burnt with fire.\n\n7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings\nbe eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither\nshall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an\nabomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.\n\n7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;\nit shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean\nshall eat thereof.\n\n7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace\nofferings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon\nhim, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the\nuncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean\nthing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which\npertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his\npeople.\n\n7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or\nof sheep, or of goat.\n\n7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of\nthat which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye\nshall in no wise eat of it.\n\n7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it\nshall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl\nor of beast, in any of your dwellings.\n\n7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that\nsoul shall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his\npeace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD\nof the sacrifice of his peace offerings.\n\n7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\nthe fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be\nwaved for a wave offering before the LORD.\n\n7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast\nshall be Aaron's and his sons'.\n\n7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave\noffering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.\n\n7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace\nofferings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.\n\n7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the\nchildren of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,\nand have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a\nstatute for ever from among the children of Israel.\n\n7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the\nanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\nin the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the\npriest's office; 7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the\nchildren of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for\never throughout their generations.\n\n7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and\nof the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the\nconsecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 Which\nthe LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded\nthe children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the\nwilderness of Sinai.\n\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sons\nwith him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for\nthe sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3\nAnd gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the\ntabernacle of the congregation.\n\n8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was\ngathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the\nLORD commanded to be done.\n\n8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.\n\n8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and\nclothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded\nhim with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him\ntherewith.\n\n8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the\nbreastplate the Urim and the Thummim.\n\n8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon\nhis forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the\nLORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and\nall that was therein, and sanctified them.\n\n8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed\nthe altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to\nsanctify them.\n\n8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and\nanointed him, to sanctify him.\n\n8:13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and\ngirded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and\nhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin\noffering.\n\n8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the\nhorns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the\naltar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified\nit, to make reconciliation upon it.\n\n8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul\nabove the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned\nit upon the altar.\n\n8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt\nwith fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his\nsons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n\n8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar\nround about.\n\n8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the\npieces, and the fat.\n\n8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt\nthe whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet\nsavour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron\nand his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n\n8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it\nupon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right\nhand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.\n\n8:24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the\ntip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and\nupon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood\nupon the altar round about.\n\n8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon\nthe inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and\ntheir fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket of\nunleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened\ncake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the\nfat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron's\nhands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD.\n\n8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the\naltar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet\nsavour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as\nthe LORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was\nupon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,\nand upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and\nsanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'\ngarments with him.\n\n8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the\nbread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,\nAaron and his sons shall eat it.\n\n8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye\nburn with fire.\n\n8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at\nan end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.\n\n8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to\nmake an atonement for you.\n\n8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the\nLORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.\n\n8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by\nthe hand of Moses.\n\n9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and\nhis sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take\nthee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,\nwithout blemish, and offer them before the LORD.\n\n9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye\na kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of\nthe first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also a\nbullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;\nand a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear\nunto you.\n\n9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle\nof the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood\nbefore the LORD.\n\n9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye\nshould do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.\n\n9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin\noffering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,\nand for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an\natonement for them; as the LORD commanded.\n\n9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin\noffering, which was for himself.\n\n9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped\nhis finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and\npoured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, and\nthe kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he\nburnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.\n\n9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.\n\n9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces\nthereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.\n\n9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the\nburnt offering on the altar.\n\n9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which\nwas the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for\nsin, as the first.\n\n9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to\nthe manner.\n\n9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,\nand burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the\nmorning.\n\n9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace\nofferings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 And\nthe fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which\ncovereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:\n9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon\nthe altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for\na wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.\n\n9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,\nand came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt\noffering, and peace offerings.\n\n9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,\nand came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD\nappeared unto all the people.\n\n9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon\nthe altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people\nsaw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.\n\n10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his\ncenser, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered\nstrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.\n\n10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and\nthey died before the LORD.\n\n10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,\nsaying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all\nthe people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.\n\n10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the\nuncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren\nfrom before the sanctuary out of the camp.\n\n10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the\ncamp; as Moses had said.\n\n10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his\nsons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,\nand lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the\nwhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.\n\n10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon\nyou. And they did according to the word of Moses.\n\n10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor\nstrong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the\ntabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for\never throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put difference\nbetween holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And that\nye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD\nhath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.\n\n10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,\nhis sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the\nofferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside\nthe altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy\nplace, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of\nthe LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.\n\n10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean\nplace; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be\nthy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of\npeace offerings of the children of Israel.\n\n10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the\nofferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a\nstatute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.\n\n10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,\nbehold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the\nsons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have ye\nnot eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,\nand God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to\nmake atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood of\nit was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have\neaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.\n\n10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered\ntheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such\nthings have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,\nshould it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And when\nMoses heard that, he was content.\n\n11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,\n11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts\nwhich ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.\n\n11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the\ncud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.\n\n11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or\nof them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the\ncud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,\nyet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n\n11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not\ntouch; they are unclean to you.\n\n11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath\nfins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them\nshall ye eat.\n\n11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the\nrivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which\nis in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 They\nshall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their\nflesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be\nan abomination unto you.\n\n11:13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the\nfowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle,\nand the ossifrage, and the ospray, 11:14 And the vulture, and the kite\nafter his kind; 11:15 Every raven after his kind; 11:16 And the owl,\nand the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 11:17\nAnd the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 11:18 And\nthe swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 11:19 And the stork,\nthe heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\n\n11:20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an\nabomination unto you.\n\n11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth\nupon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon\nthe earth; 11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his\nkind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his\nkind, and the grasshopper after his kind.\n\n11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,\nshall be an abomination unto you.\n\n11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the\ncarcase of them shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash\nhis clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not\nclovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one\nthat toucheth them shall be unclean.\n\n11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts\nthat go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their\ncarcase shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,\nand be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.\n\n11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things\nthat creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise\nafter his kind, 11:30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the\nlizard, and the snail, and the mole.\n\n11:31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth\ntouch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,\nit shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or\nskin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it\nmust be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it\nshall be cleansed.\n\n11:33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,\nwhatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.\n\n11:34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh\nshall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel\nshall be unclean.\n\n11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth\nshall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall\nbe broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.\n\n11:36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of\nwater, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be\nunclean.\n\n11:37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which\nis to be sown, it shall be clean.\n\n11:38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their\ncarcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.\n\n11:39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the\ncarcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,\nand be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it\nshall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n11:41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be\nan abomination; it shall not be eaten.\n\n11:42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all\nfour, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that\ncreep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an\nabomination.\n\n11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing\nthat creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,\nthat ye should be defiled thereby.\n\n11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify\nyourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye\ndefile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon\nthe earth.\n\n11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,\nto be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.\n\n11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every\nliving creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that\ncreepeth upon the earth: 11:47 To make a difference between the\nunclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the\nbeast that may not be eaten.\n\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a\nman child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days\nof the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.\n\n12:3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be\ncircumcised.\n\n12:4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three\nand thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the\nsanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.\n\n12:5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two\nweeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of\nher purifying threescore and six days.\n\n12:6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or\nfor a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt\noffering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,\nunto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:\n12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for\nher; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is\nthe law for her that hath born a male or a female.\n\n12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two\nturtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the\nother for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for\nher, and she shall be clean.\n\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a man\nshall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,\nand it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he\nshall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the\npriests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of\nthe flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the\nplague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague\nof leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him\nunclean.\n\n13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in\nsight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned\nwhite; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven\ndays: 13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,\nbehold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread\nnot in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:\n13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,\nbehold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in\nthe skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and\nhe shall wash his clothes, and be clean.\n\n13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he\nhath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of\nthe priest again.\n\n13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the\nskin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.\n\n13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought\nunto the priest; 13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if\nthe rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,\nand there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 It is an old leprosy\nin the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,\nand shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.\n\n13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy\ncover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to\nhis foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 Then the priest shall\nconsider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he\nshall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned\nwhite: he is clean.\n\n13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.\n\n13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be\nunclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.\n\n13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he\nshall come unto the priest; 13:17 And the priest shall see him: and,\nbehold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall\npronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.\n\n13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,\nand is healed, 13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a white\nrising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be\nshewed to the priest; 13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,\nit be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned\nwhite; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of\nleprosy broken out of the boil.\n\n13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white\nhairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat\ndark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:22 And if it\nspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him\nunclean: it is a plague.\n\n13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is\na burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot\nburning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,\nsomewhat reddish, or white; 13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it:\nand, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be\nin sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the\nburning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the\nplague of leprosy.\n\n13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white\nhair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but\nbe somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27\nAnd the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be\nspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him\nunclean: it is the plague of leprosy.\n\n13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the\nskin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the\npriest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the\nburning.\n\n13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;\n13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in\nsight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair;\nthen the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a\nleprosy upon the head or beard.\n\n13:31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,\nit be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black\nhair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of\nthe scall seven days: 13:32 And in the seventh day the priest shall\nlook on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be\nin it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the\nskin; 13:33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and\nthe priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:\n13:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,\nbehold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper\nthan the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall\nwash his clothes, and be clean.\n\n13:35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;\n13:36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be\nspread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is\nunclean.\n\n13:37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is\nblack hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the\npriest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n13:38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright\nspots, even white bright spots; 13:39 Then the priest shall look: and,\nbehold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish\nwhite; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.\n\n13:40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet\nis he clean.\n\n13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head\ntoward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.\n\n13:42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white\nreddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald\nforehead.\n\n13:43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising\nof the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald\nforehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 13:44 He\nis a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him\nutterly unclean; his plague is in his head.\n\n13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,\nand his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and\nshall cry, Unclean, unclean.\n\n13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be\ndefiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall\nhis habitation be.\n\n13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be\na woollen garment, or a linen garment; 13:48 Whether it be in the\nwarp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any\nthing made of skin; 13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in\nthe garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in\nany thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto\nthe priest: 13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut\nup it that hath the plague seven days: 13:51 And he shall look on the\nplague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment,\neither in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that\nis made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.\n\n13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in\nwoollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for\nit is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n13:53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not\nspread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any\nthing of skin; 13:54 Then the priest shall command that they wash the\nthing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:\n13:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is\nwashed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and\nthe plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the\nfire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.\n\n13:56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark\nafter the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or\nout of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 13:57 And if\nit appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or\nin any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that\nwherein the plague is with fire.\n\n13:58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of\nskin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from\nthem, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.\n\n13:59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen\nor linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to\npronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.\n\n14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 This shall be the law\nof the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the\npriest: 14:3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the\npriest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in\nthe leper; 14:4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is\nto be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet,\nand hyssop: 14:5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be\nkilled in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:6 As for the living\nbird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the\nhyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the\nbird that was killed over the running water: 14:7 And he shall\nsprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,\nand shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose\ninto the open field.\n\n14:8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave\noff all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and\nafter that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of\nhis tent seven days.\n\n14:9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his\nhair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he\nshall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his\nflesh in water, and he shall be clean.\n\n14:10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without\nblemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three\ntenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and\none log of oil.\n\n14:11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that\nis to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation: 14:12 And the priest shall take\none he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of\noil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 14:13 And he\nshall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering\nand the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is\nthe priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 14:14 And\nthe priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and\nthe priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is\nto be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the\ngreat toe of his right foot: 14:15 And the priest shall take some of\nthe log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 14:16\nAnd the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his\nleft hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times\nbefore the LORD: 14:17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand\nshall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\ntoe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 14:18\nAnd the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour\nupon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make\nan atonement for him before the LORD.\n\n14:19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an\natonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and\nafterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 14:20 And the priest shall\noffer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.\n\n14:21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take\none lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for\nhim, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat\noffering, and a log of oil; 14:22 And two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin\noffering, and the other a burnt offering.\n\n14:23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto\nthe priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,\nbefore the LORD.\n\n14:24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and\nthe log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD: 14:25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass\noffering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass\noffering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\ntoe of his right foot: 14:26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into\nthe palm of his own left hand: 14:27 And the priest shall sprinkle\nwith his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven\ntimes before the LORD: 14:28 And the priest shall put of the oil that\nis in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be\ncleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe\nof his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass\noffering: 14:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand\nhe shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an\natonement for him before the LORD.\n\n14:30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young\npigeons, such as he can get; 14:31 Even such as he is able to get, the\none for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the\nmeat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is\nto be cleansed before the LORD.\n\n14:32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose\nhand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.\n\n14:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:34 When\nye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a\npossession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of\nyour possession; 14:35 And he that owneth the house shall come and\ntell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague\nin the house: 14:36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the\nhouse, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that\nis in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go\nin to see the house: 14:37 And he shall look on the plague, and,\nbehold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow\nstrakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;\n14:38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the\nhouse, and shut up the house seven days: 14:39 And the priest shall\ncome again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague\nbe spread in the walls of the house; 14:40 Then the priest shall\ncommand that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and\nthey shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 14:41 And\nhe shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they\nshall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an\nunclean place: 14:42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in\nthe place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall\nplaister the house.\n\n14:43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after\nthat he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the\nhouse, and after it is plaistered; 14:44 Then the priest shall come\nand look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a\nfretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.\n\n14:45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the\ntimber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry\nthem forth out of the city into an unclean place.\n\n14:46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is\nshut up shall be unclean until the even.\n\n14:47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he\nthat eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.\n\n14:48 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold,\nthe plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was\nplaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because\nthe plague is healed.\n\n14:49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar\nwood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 14:50 And he shall kill the one of the\nbirds in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:51 And he shall take\nthe cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird,\nand dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water,\nand sprinkle the house seven times: 14:52 And he shall cleanse the\nhouse with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with\nthe living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and\nwith the scarlet: 14:53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the\ncity into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it\nshall be clean.\n\n14:54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,\n14:55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 14:56 And for\na rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 14:57 To teach when\nit is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.\n\n15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 15:2 Speak\nunto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a\nrunning issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.\n\n15:3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh\nrun with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his\nuncleanness.\n\n15:4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and\nevery thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.\n\n15:5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe\nhimself in water, and be unclean until the even.\n\n15:6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the\nissue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be\nunclean until the even.\n\n15:7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall\nwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the\neven.\n\n15:8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then\nhe shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean\nuntil the even.\n\n15:9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall\nbe unclean.\n\n15:10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be\nunclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall\nwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the\neven.\n\n15:11 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not\nrinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe\nhimself in water, and be unclean until the even.\n\n15:12 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue,\nshall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.\n\n15:13 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he\nshall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his\nclothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.\n\n15:14 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or\ntwo young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the\ntabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest: 15:15\nAnd the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the\nother for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for\nhim before the LORD for his issue.\n\n15:16 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he\nshall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.\n\n15:17 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of\ncopulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.\n\n15:18 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation,\nthey shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the\neven.\n\n15:19 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be\nblood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her\nshall be unclean until the even.\n\n15:20 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be\nunclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.\n\n15:21 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe\nhimself in water, and be unclean until the even.\n\n15:22 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash\nhis clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the\neven.\n\n15:23 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,\nwhen he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.\n\n15:24 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him,\nhe shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall\nbe unclean.\n\n15:25 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the\ntime of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her\nseparation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as\nthe days of her separation: she shall be unclean.\n\n15:26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be\nunto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon\nshall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.\n\n15:27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall\nwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the\neven.\n\n15:28 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to\nherself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.\n\n15:29 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or\ntwo young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the\ntabernacle of the congregation.\n\n15:30 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the\nother for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for\nher before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.\n\n15:31 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their\nuncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile\nmy tabernacle that is among them.\n\n15:32 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed\ngoeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 15:33 And of her that is\nsick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of\nthe woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.\n\n16:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of\nAaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died; 16:2 And the LORD\nsaid unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all\ntimes into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which\nis upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon\nthe mercy seat.\n\n16:3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock\nfor a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.\n\n16:4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen\nbreeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and\nwith the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments;\ntherefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.\n\n16:5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel\ntwo kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt\noffering.\n\n16:6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is\nfor himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.\n\n16:7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD\nat the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the\nLORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.\n\n16:9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,\nand offer him for a sin offering.\n\n16:10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall\nbe presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and\nto let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.\n\n16:11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is\nfor himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his\nhouse, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for\nhimself: 16:12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of\nfire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet\nincense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: 16:13 And he shall\nput the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the\nincense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he\ndie not: 16:14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and\nsprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward;

neither shall ye make any offering thereof\nin your land.\n\n22:25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your\nGod of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and\nblemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.\n\n22:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:27 When a bullock, or\na sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days\nunder the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be\naccepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n22:28 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her\nyoung both in one day.\n\n22:29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the\nLORD, offer it at your own will.\n\n22:30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it\nuntil the morrow: I am the LORD.\n\n22:31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the\nLORD.\n\n22:32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed\namong the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you, 22:33\nThat brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the\nLORD.\n\n23:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the\nLORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are\nmy feasts.\n\n23:3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath\nof rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the\nsabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.\n\n23:4 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which\nye shall proclaim in their seasons.\n\n23:5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's\npassover.\n\n23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of\nunleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened\nbread.\n\n23:7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do\nno servile work therein.\n\n23:8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven\ndays: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no\nservile work therein.\n\n23:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:10 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land\nwhich I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye\nshall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the\npriest: 23:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be\naccepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall\nwave it.\n\n23:12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb\nwithout blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.\n\n23:13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine\nflour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a\nsweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the\nfourth part of an hin.\n\n23:14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green\nears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto\nyour God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations\nin all your dwellings.\n\n23:15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,\nfrom the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven\nsabbaths shall be complete: 23:16 Even unto the morrow after the\nseventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new\nmeat offering unto the LORD.\n\n23:17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two\ntenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with\nleaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.\n\n23:18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of\nthe first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for\na burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their\ndrink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto\nthe LORD.\n\n23:19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,\nand two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.\n\n23:20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits\nfor a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be\nholy to the LORD for the priest.\n\n23:21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an\nholy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it\nshall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your\ngenerations.\n\n23:22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make\nclean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither\nshalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them\nunto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.\n\n23:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:24 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of\nthe month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets,\nan holy convocation.\n\n23:25 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n23:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:27 Also on the tenth\nday of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall\nbe an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and\noffer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n23:28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of\natonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.\n\n23:29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that\nsame day, he shall be cut off from among his people.\n\n23:30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day,\nthe same soul will I destroy from among his people.\n\n23:31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever\nthroughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n\n23:32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict\nyour souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto\neven, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.\n\n23:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:34 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month\nshall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.\n\n23:35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no\nservile work therein.\n\n23:36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the\nLORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye\nshall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn\nassembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.\n\n23:37 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be\nholy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a\nburnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings,\nevery thing upon his day: 23:38 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and\nbeside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your\nfreewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.\n\n23:39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have\ngathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD\nseven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day\nshall be a sabbath.\n\n23:40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly\ntrees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and\nwillows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God\nseven days.\n\n23:41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the\nyear.\n\nIt shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate\nit in the seventh month.\n\n23:42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites\nborn shall dwell in booths: 23:43 That your generations may know that\nI made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them\nout of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\n\n23:44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the\nLORD.\n\n24:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:2 Command the children\nof Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the\nlight, to cause the lamps to burn continually.\n\n24:3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning\nbefore the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your\ngenerations.\n\n24:4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the\nLORD continually.\n\n24:5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:\ntwo tenth deals shall be in one cake.\n\n24:6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure\ntable before the LORD.\n\n24:7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may\nbe on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the\nLORD.\n\n24:8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD\ncontinually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting\ncovenant.\n\n24:9 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in\nthe holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the\nLORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.\n\n24:10 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an\nEgyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the\nIsraelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;\n24:11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord,\nand cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name\nwas Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 24:12 And\nthey put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.\n\n24:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:14 Bring forth him\nthat hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay\ntheir hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.\n\n24:15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,\nWhosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.\n\n24:16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be\nput to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as\nwell the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth\nthe name of the Lord, shall be put to death.\n\n24:17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.\n\n24:18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.\n\n24:19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done,\nso shall it be done to him; 24:20 Breach for breach, eye for eye,\ntooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be\ndone to him again.\n\n24:21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that\nkilleth a man, he shall be put to death.\n\n24:22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as\nfor one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.\n\n24:23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should\nbring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with\nstones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 25:2 Speak\nunto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the\nland which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the\nLORD.\n\n25:3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt\nprune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 25:4 But in the\nseventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for\nthe LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.\n\n25:5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt\nnot reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a\nyear of rest unto the land.\n\n25:6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and\nfor thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for\nthy stranger that sojourneth with thee.\n\n25:7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall\nall the increase thereof be meat.\n\n25:8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven\ntimes seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall\nbe unto thee forty and nine years.\n\n25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the\ntenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make\nthe trumpet sound throughout all your land.\n\n25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty\nthroughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be\na jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,\nand ye shall return every man unto his family.\n\n25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,\nneither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes\nin it of thy vine undressed.\n\n25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat\nthe increase thereof out of the field.\n\n25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his\npossession.\n\n25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of\nthy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 25:15\nAccording to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of\nthy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he\nshall sell unto thee: 25:16 According to the multitude of years thou\nshalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of\nyears thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number\nof the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.\n\n25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear\nthy God:for I am the LORD your God.\n\n25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do\nthem; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.\n\n25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,\nand dwell therein in safety.\n\n25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,\nwe shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 25:21 Then I will\ncommand my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring\nforth fruit for three years.\n\n25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until\nthe ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old\nstore.\n\n25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for\nye are strangers and sojourners with me.\n\n25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a\nredemption for the land.\n\n25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his\npossession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he\nredeem that which his brother sold.\n\n25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to\nredeem it; 25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and\nrestore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may\nreturn unto his possession.\n\n25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is\nsold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the\nyear of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return\nunto his possession.\n\n25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may\nredeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may\nhe redeem it.\n\n25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then\nthe house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to\nhim that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in\nthe jubile.\n\n25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about\nthem shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be\nredeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.\n\n25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the\ncities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.\n\n25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was\nsold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of\njubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their\npossession among the children of Israel.\n\n25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;\nfor it is their perpetual possession.\n\n25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;\nthen thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a\nsojourner; that he may live with thee.\n\n25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that\nthy brother may live with thee.\n\n25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy\nvictuals for increase.\n\n25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land\nof Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.\n\n25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be\nsold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:\n25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with\nthee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.\n\n25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children\nwith him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the\npossession of his fathers shall he return.\n\n25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land\nof Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.\n\n25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy\nGod.\n\n25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,\nshall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy\nbondmen and bondmaids.\n\n25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among\nyou, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,\nwhich they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.\n\n25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after\nyou, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for\never: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule\none over another with rigour.\n\n25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother\nthat dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or\nsojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 25:48\nAfter that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren\nmay redeem him: 25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem\nhim, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him;\nor if he be able, he may redeem himself.\n\n25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that\nhe was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale\nshall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of\nan hired servant shall it be with him.\n\n25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall\ngive again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was\nbought for.\n\n25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then\nhe shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give\nhim again the price of his redemption.\n\n25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the\nother shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.\n\n25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out\nin the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.\n\n25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my\nservants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD\nyour God.\n\n26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up\na standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your\nland, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.\n\n26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the\nLORD.\n\n26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;\n26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield\nher increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.\n\n26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage\nshall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the\nfull, and dwell in your land safely.\n\n26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and\nnone shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the\nland, neither shall the sword go through your land.\n\n26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you\nby the sword.\n\n26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you\nshall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before\nyou by the sword.\n\n26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and\nmultiply you, and establish my covenant with you.\n\n26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of\nthe new.\n\n26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor\nyou.\n\n26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be\nmy people.\n\n26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land\nof Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the\nbands of your yoke, and made you go upright.\n\n26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these\ncommandments; 26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your\nsoul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,\nbut that ye break my covenant: 26:16 I also will do this unto you; I\nwill even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,\nthat shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall\nsow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.\n\n26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before\nyour enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall\nflee when none pursueth you.\n\n26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will\npunish you seven times more for your sins.\n\n26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your\nheaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 26:20 And your strength shall\nbe spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither\nshall the trees of the land yield their fruits.\n\n26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I\nwill bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.\n\n26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of\nyour children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number;\nand your high ways shall be desolate.\n\n26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will\nwalk contrary unto me; 26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you,\nand will punish you yet seven times for your sins.\n\n26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel\nof my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities,\nI will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into\nthe hand of the enemy.\n\n26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall\nbake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread\nagain by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.\n\n26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk\ncontrary unto me; 26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in\nfury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.\n\n26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your\ndaughters shall ye eat.\n\n26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,\nand cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul\nshall abhor you.\n\n26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries\nunto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.\n\n26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies\nwhich dwell therein shall be astonished at it.\n\n26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a\nsword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities\nwaste.\n\n26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth\ndesolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land\nrest, and enjoy her sabbaths.\n\n26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not\nrest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.\n\n26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness\ninto their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a\nshaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a\nsword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.\n\n26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,\nwhen none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your\nenemies.\n\n26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your\nenemies shall eat you up.\n\n26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity\nin your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers\nshall they pine away with them.\n\n26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their\nfathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and\nthat also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 And that I also\nhave walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of\ntheir enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they\nthen accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 Then will I\nremember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and\nalso my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the\nland.\n\n26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her\nsabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept\nof the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they\ndespised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.\n\n26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,\nI will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them\nutterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their\nGod.\n\n26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their\nancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight\nof the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.\n\n26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD\nmade between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand\nof Moses.\n\n27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a\nsingular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.\n\n27:3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old\neven unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels\nof silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.\n\n27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty\nshekels.\n\n27:5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then\nthy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female\nten shekels.\n\n27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy\nestimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the\nfemale thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.\n\n27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,\nthen thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten\nshekels.\n\n27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present\nhimself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;

the possession thereof shall be the\npriest's.\n\n27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath\nbought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 Then the\npriest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto\nthe year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that\nday, as a holy thing unto the LORD.\n\n27:24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of\nwhom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did\nbelong.\n\n27:25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the\nsanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.\n\n27:26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's\nfirstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is\nthe LORD's.\n\n27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it\naccording to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it\nthereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to\nthy estimation.\n\n27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto\nthe LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field\nof his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is\nmost holy unto the LORD.\n\n27:29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;\nbut shall surely be put to death.\n\n27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,\nor of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.\n\n27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall\nadd thereto the fifth part thereof.\n\n27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of\nwhatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the\nLORD.\n\n27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he\nchange it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change\nthereof shall be holy;

This was the dedication of the altar,\nafter that it was anointed.\n\n7:89 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation\nto speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him\nfrom off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from\nbetween the two cherubims: and he spake unto him.\n\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Speak unto Aaron and\nsay unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give\nlight over against the candlestick.\n\n8:3 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the\ncandlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:4 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the\nshaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according\nunto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the\ncandlestick.\n\n8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:6 Take the Levites from\namong the children of Israel, and cleanse them.\n\n8:7 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water\nof purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let\nthem wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.\n\n8:8 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even\nfine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take\nfor a sin offering.\n\n8:9 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the\ncongregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children\nof Israel together: 8:10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the\nLORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the\nLevites: 8:11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an\noffering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service\nof the LORD.\n\n8:12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the\nbullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the\nother for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for\nthe Levites.\n\n8:13 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,\nand offer them for an offering unto the LORD.\n\n8:14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of\nIsrael: and the Levites shall be mine.\n\n8:15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the\ntabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer\nthem for an offering.\n\n8:16 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of\nIsrael; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the\nfirstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.\n\n8:17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both\nman and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of\nEgypt I sanctified them for myself.\n\n8:18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the\nchildren of Israel.\n\n8:19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons\nfrom among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children\nof Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an\natonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among\nthe children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the\nsanctuary.\n\n8:20 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of\nIsrael, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded\nMoses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.\n\n8:21 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and\nAaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an\natonement for them to cleanse them.\n\n8:22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the\ntabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as\nthe LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto\nthem.\n\n8:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:24 This is it that\nbelongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward\nthey shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation: 8:25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease\nwaiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more: 8:26 But\nshall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt\nthou do unto the Levites touching their charge.\n\n9:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the\nfirst month of the second year after they were come out of the land of\nEgypt, saying, 9:2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover\nat his appointed season.\n\n9:3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in\nhis appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according\nto all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.\n\n9:4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep\nthe passover.\n\n9:5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first\nmonth at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the\nLORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.\n\n9:6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a\nman, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came\nbefore Moses and before Aaron on that day: 9:7 And those men said unto\nhim, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept\nback, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed\nseason among the children of Israel?  9:8 And Moses said unto them,\nStand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning\nyou.\n\n9:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity\nshall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar\noff, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.\n\n9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep\nit, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.\n\n9:12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone\nof it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep\nit.\n\n9:13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and\nforbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off\nfrom among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD\nin his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.\n\n9:14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the\npassover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover,\nand according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one\nordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the\nland.\n\n9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud\ncovered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even\nthere was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until\nthe morning.\n\n9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance\nof fire by night.\n\n9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after\nthat the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the\ncloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.\n\n9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,\nand at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud\nabode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.\n\n9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,\nthen the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed\nnot.\n\n9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;\naccording to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,\nand according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.\n\n9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,\nand that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:\nwhether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they\njourneyed.\n\n9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the\ncloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of\nIsrael abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken\nup, they journeyed.\n\n9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at\nthe commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of\nthe LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\n\n10:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee two\ntrumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou\nmayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the\njourneying of the camps.\n\n10:3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall\nassemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n10:4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which\nare heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto\nthee.\n\n10:5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts\nshall go forward.\n\n10:6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on\nthe south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for\ntheir journeys.\n\n10:7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall\nblow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.\n\n10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;\nand they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your\ngenerations.\n\n10:9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that\noppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye\nshall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved\nfrom your enemies.\n\n10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and\nin the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over\nyour burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;\nthat they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD\nyour God.\n\n10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in\nthe second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle\nof the testimony.\n\n10:12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the\nwilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.\n\n10:13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment\nof the LORD by the hand of Moses.\n\n10:14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children\nof Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the\nson of Amminadab.\n\n10:15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was\nNethaneel the son of Zuar.\n\n10:16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was\nEliab the son of Helon.\n\n10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and\nthe sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.\n\n10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to\ntheir armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.\n\n10:19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was\nShelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\n\n10:20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was\nEliasaph the son of Deuel.\n\n10:21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the\nother did set up the tabernacle against they came.\n\n10:22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set\nforward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the\nson of Ammihud.\n\n10:23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was\nGamaliel the son of Pedahzur.\n\n10:24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was\nAbidan the son of Gideoni.\n\n10:25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,\nwhich was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and\nover his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.\n\n10:26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was\nPagiel the son of Ocran.\n\n10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was\nAhira the son of Enan.\n\n10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to\ntheir armies, when they set forward.\n\n10:29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,\nMoses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the\nLORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee\ngood: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.\n\n10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine\nown land, and to my kindred.\n\n10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou\nknowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to\nus instead of eyes.\n\n10:32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what\ngoodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.\n\n10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'\njourney: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in\nthe three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.\n\n10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went\nout of the camp.\n\n10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,\nRise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that\nhate thee flee before thee.\n\n10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many\nthousands of Israel.\n\n11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the\nLORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD\nburnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts\nof the camp.\n\n11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the\nLORD, the fire was quenched.\n\n11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of\nthe LORD burnt among them.\n\n11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and\nthe children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us\nflesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt\nfreely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,\nand the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing\nat all, beside this manna, before our eyes.\n\n11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as\nthe colour of bdellium.\n\n11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in\nmills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of\nit: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.\n\n11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell\nupon it.\n\n11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,\nevery man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was\nkindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.\n\n11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy\nservant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou\nlayest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived\nall this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto\nme, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking\nchild, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13\nWhence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep\nunto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.\n\n11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too\nheavy for me.\n\n11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of\nhand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my\nwretchedness.\n\n11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the\nelders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,\nand officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, that they may stand there with thee.\n\n11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take\nof the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they\nshall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not\nthyself alone.\n\n11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to\nmorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the\nLORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us\nin Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.\n\n11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither\nten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come\nout at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye\nhave despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,\nsaying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, The\npeople, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou\nhast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.\n\n11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice\nthem?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,\nto suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's\nhand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to\npass unto thee or not.\n\n11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,\nand gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them\nround about the tabernacle.\n\n11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took\nof the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:\nand it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they\nprophesied, and did not cease.\n\n11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the\none was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested\nupon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out\nunto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.\n\n11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and\nMedad do prophesy in the camp.\n\n11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his\nyoung men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.\n\n11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God\nthat all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put\nhis spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and\nthe elders of Israel.\n\n11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails\nfrom the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's\njourney on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other\nside, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the\nface of the earth.\n\n11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and\nall the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least\ngathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves\nround about the camp.\n\n11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was\nchewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the\nLORD smote the people with a very great plague.\n\n11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because\nthere they buried the people that lusted.\n\n11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;\nand abode at Hazeroth.\n\n12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian\nwoman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.\n\n12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he\nnot spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.\n\n12:3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were\nupon the face of the earth.)  12:4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto\nMoses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the\ntabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.\n\n12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in\nthe door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both\ncame forth.\n\n12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,\nI the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak\nunto him in a dream.\n\n12:7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.\n\n12:8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in\ndark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:\nwherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?\n12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he\ndeparted.\n\n12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,\nMiriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,\nand, behold, she was leprous.\n\n12:11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay\nnot the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we\nhave sinned.\n\n12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed\nwhen he cometh out of his mother's womb.\n\n12:13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I\nbeseech thee.\n\n12:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her\nface, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from\nthe camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.\n\n12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people\njourneyed not till Miriam was brought in again.\n\n12:16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in\nthe wilderness of Paran.\n\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that\nthey may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of\nIsrael: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one\na ruler among them.\n\n13:3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the\nwilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of\nIsrael.\n\n13:4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the\nson of Zaccur.\n\n13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.\n\n13:6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.\n\n13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.\n\n13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.\n\n13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.\n\n13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.\n\n13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi\nthe son of Susi.\n\n13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.\n\n13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.\n\n13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.\n\n13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.\n\n13:16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the\nland.\n\nAnd Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.\n\n13:17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto\nthem, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:\n13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth\ntherein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And what\nthe land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what\ncities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong\nholds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether\nthere be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of\nthe fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe\ngrapes.\n\n13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of\nZin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.\n\n13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where\nAhiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron\nwas built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  13:23 And they came unto\nthe brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one\ncluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they\nbrought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.\n\n13:24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of\ngrapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.\n\n13:25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.\n\n13:26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the\ncongregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,\nto Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the\ncongregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.\n\n13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou\nsentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the\nfruit of it.\n\n13:28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and\nthe cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the\nchildren of Anak there.\n\n13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,\nand the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the\nCanaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.\n\n13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go\nup at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.\n\n13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up\nagainst the people; for they are stronger than we.\n\n13:32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had\nsearched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which\nwe have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants\nthereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great\nstature.\n\n13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the\ngiants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were\nin their sight.\n\n14:1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and\nthe people wept that night.\n\n14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against\nAaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we\nhad died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this\nwilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this\nland, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be\na prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And they\nsaid one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into\nEgypt.\n\n14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly\nof the congregation of the children of Israel.\n\n14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which\nwere of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And they\nspake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The\nland, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.\n\n14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,\nand give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.\n\n14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of\nthe land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from\nthem, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.\n\n14:10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the\nglory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation\nbefore all the children of Israel.\n\n14:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke\nme?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs\nwhich I have shewed among them?  14:12 I will smite them with the\npestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater\nnation and mightier than they.\n\n14:13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,\n(for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)\n14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they\nhave heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art\nseen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that\nthou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a\npillar of fire by night.\n\n14:15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the\nnations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 14:16\nBecause the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which\nhe sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.\n\n14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,\naccording as thou hast spoken, saying, 14:18 The LORD is\nlongsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and\ntransgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the\niniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth\ngeneration.\n\n14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according\nunto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this\npeople, from Egypt even until now.\n\n14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21\nBut as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory\nof the LORD.\n\n14:22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,\nwhich I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now\nthese ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 14:23 Surely they\nshall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall\nany of them that provoked me see it: 14:24 But my servant Caleb,\nbecause he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully,\nhim will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall\npossess it.\n\n14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)\nTomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the\nRed sea.\n\n14:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 How\nlong shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against\nme? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they\nmurmur against me.\n\n14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have\nspoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 14:29 Your carcases shall\nfall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according\nto your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have\nmurmured against me.\n\n14:30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I\nsware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and\nJoshua the son of Nun.\n\n14:31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will\nI bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.\n\n14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this\nwilderness.\n\n14:33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,\nand bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the\nwilderness.\n\n14:34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even\nforty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even\nforty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.\n\n14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil\ncongregation, that are gathered together against me: in this\nwilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.\n\n14:36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,\nand made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a\nslander upon the land, 14:37 Even those men that did bring up the evil\nreport upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.\n\n14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which\nwere of the men that went to search the land, lived still.\n\n14:39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:\nand the people mourned greatly.\n\n14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the\ntop of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the\nplace which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.\n\n14:41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment\nof the LORD? but it shall not prosper.\n\n14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten\nbefore your enemies.\n\n14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and\nye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD,\ntherefore the LORD will not be with you.\n\n14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the\nark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the\ncamp.\n\n14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in\nthat hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.\n\n15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land\nof your habitations, which I give unto you, 15:3 And will make an\noffering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in\nperforming a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,\nto make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:\n15:4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a\nmeat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of\nan hin of oil.\n\n15:5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt\nthou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.\n\n15:6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth\ndeals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.\n\n15:7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an\nhin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n15:8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a\nsacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 15:9\nThen shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth\ndeals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.\n\n15:10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,\nfor an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n15:11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a\nlamb, or a kid.\n\n15:12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to\nevery one according to their number.\n\n15:13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after\nthis manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour\nunto the LORD.\n\n15:14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in\nyour generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet\nsavour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.\n\n15:15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and\nalso for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever\nin your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the\nLORD.\n\n15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger\nthat sojourneth with you.\n\n15:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land\nwhither I bring you, 15:19 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the\nbread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.\n\n15:20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave\noffering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall\nye heave it.\n\n15:21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave\noffering in your generations.\n\n15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,\nwhich the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 15:23 Even all that the LORD\nhath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD\ncommanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 Then\nit shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge\nof the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young\nbullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with\nhis meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,\nand one kid of the goats for a sin offering.\n\n15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation\nof the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is\nignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by\nfire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their\nignorance: 15:26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the\nchildren of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;\nseeing all the people were in ignorance.\n\n15:27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she\ngoat of the first year for a sin offering.\n\n15:28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth\nignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an\natonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,\nboth for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the\nstranger that sojourneth among them.\n\n15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born\nin the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that\nsoul shall be cut off from among his people.\n\n15:31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken\nhis commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity\nshall be upon him.\n\n15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they\nfound a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.\n\n15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses\nand Aaron, and unto all the congregation.\n\n15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what\nshould be done to him.\n\n15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to\ndeath: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the\ncamp.\n\n15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and\nstoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the\nborders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they\nput upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 15:39 And it\nshall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember\nall the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not\nafter your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a\nwhoring: 15:40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and\nbe holy unto your God.\n\n15:41 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of\nEgypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.\n\n16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,\nand Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth,\nsons of Reuben, took men: 16:2 And they rose up before Moses, with\ncertain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of\nthe assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 16:3 And they\ngathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said\nunto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are\nholy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then\nlift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?  16:4 And\nwhen Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 16:5 And he spake unto\nKorah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will\nshew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near\nunto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto\nhim.\n\n16:6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 And\nput fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:\nand it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be\nholy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.\n\n16:8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:\n16:9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel\nhath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near\nto himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to\nstand before the congregation to minister unto them?  16:10 And he\nhath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi\nwith thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?  16:11 For which cause\nboth thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD:\nand what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?  16:12 And Moses sent\nto call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not\ncome up: 16:13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of\na land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,\nexcept thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?  16:14 Moreover\nthou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,\nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the\neyes of these men? we will not come up.\n\n16:15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not\nthou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have\nI hurt one of them.\n\n16:16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before\nthe LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 16:17 And take every\nman his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD\nevery man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and\nAaron, each of you his censer.\n\n16:18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and\nlaid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation with Moses and Aaron.\n\n16:19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD\nappeared unto all the congregation.\n\n16:20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21\nSeparate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume\nthem in a moment.\n\n16:22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the\nspirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with\nall the congregation?  16:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n16:24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the\ntabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\n\n16:25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the\nelders of Israel followed him.\n\n16:26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,\nfrom the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest\nye be consumed in all their sins.\n\n16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,\non every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door\nof their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little\nchildren.\n\n16:28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me\nto do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.\n\n16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be\nvisited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent\nme.\n\n16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,\nand swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go\ndown quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have\nprovoked the LORD.\n\n16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these\nwords, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 16:32 And\nthe earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,\nand all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.\n\n16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the\npit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the\ncongregation.\n\n16:34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of\nthem: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.\n\n16:35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two\nhundred and fifty men that offered incense.\n\n16:36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar\nthe son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the\nburning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.\n\n16:38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them\nmake them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered\nthem before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a\nsign unto the children of Israel.\n\n16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they\nthat were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a\ncovering of the altar: 16:40 To be a memorial unto the children of\nIsrael, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near\nto offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his\ncompany: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.\n\n16:41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel\nmurmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the\npeople of the LORD.\n\n16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against\nMoses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the\ncongregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the\nLORD appeared.\n\n16:43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n16:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up from\namong this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And\nthey fell upon their faces.\n\n16:46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein\nfrom off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the\ncongregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone\nout from the LORD; the plague is begun.\n\n16:47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the\ncongregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and\nhe put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.\n\n16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was\nstayed.\n\n16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and\nseven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.\n\n16:50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of\nthe congregation: and the plague was stayed.\n\n17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to\nthe house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the\nhouse of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon\nhis rod.\n\n17:3 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one\nrod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.\n\n17:4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation\nbefore the testimony, where I will meet with you.\n\n17:5 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall\nchoose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings\nof the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.\n\n17:6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of\ntheir princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to\ntheir fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was\namong their rods.\n\n17:7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of\nwitness.\n\n17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the\ntabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of\nLevi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and\nyielded almonds.\n\n17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all\nthe children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.\n\n17:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the\ntestimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt\nquite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.\n\n17:11 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.\n\n17:12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we\ndie, we perish, we all perish.\n\n17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD\nshall die: shall we be consumed with dying?  18:1 And the LORD said\nunto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall\nbear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee\nshall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.\n\n18:2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy\nfather, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and\nminister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister\nbefore the tabernacle of witness.\n\n18:3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the\ntabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary\nand the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.\n\n18:4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the\ntabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:\nand a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.\n\n18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of\nthe altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of\nIsrael.\n\n18:6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among\nthe children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD,\nto do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's\noffice for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall\nserve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of\ngift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.\n\n18:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the\ncharge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the\nchildren of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the\nanointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.\n\n18:9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the\nfire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and\nevery sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs\nwhich they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for\nthy sons.\n\n18:10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat\nit: it shall be holy unto thee.\n\n18:11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all\nthe wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto\nthee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for\never: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.\n\n18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of\nthe wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the\nLORD, them have I given thee.\n\n18:13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring\nunto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house\nshall eat of it.\n\n18:14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.\n\n18:15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they\nbring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:\nnevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the\nfirstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.\n\n18:16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou\nredeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.\n\n18:17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the\nfirstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt\nsprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an\noffering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n18:18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as\nthe right shoulder are thine.\n\n18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children\nof Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy\ndaughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt\nfor ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.\n\n18:20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in\ntheir land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part\nand thine inheritance among the children of Israel.\n\n18:21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in\nIsrael for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even\nthe service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n18:22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the\ntabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.\n\n18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a\nstatute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children\nof Israel they have no inheritance.\n\n18:24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an\nheave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:\ntherefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they\nshall have no inheritance.\n\n18:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26 Thus speak unto the\nLevites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the\ntithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye\nshall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part\nof the tithe.\n\n18:27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as\nthough it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of\nthe winepress.\n\n18:28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all\nyour tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall\ngive thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.\n\n18:29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the\nLORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of\nit.\n\n18:30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best\nthereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the\nincrease of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.\n\n18:31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for\nit is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n18:32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved\nfrom it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of\nthe children of Israel, lest ye die.\n\n19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2 This\nis the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying,\nSpeak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer\nwithout spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:\n19:3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring\nher forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:\n19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,\nand sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the\ncongregation seven times: 19:5 And one shall burn the heifer in his\nsight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he\nburn: 19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and\nscarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.\n\n19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his\nflesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the\npriest shall be unclean until the even.\n\n19:8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and\nbathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.\n\n19:9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,\nand lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be\nkept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of\nseparation: it is a purification for sin.\n\n19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his\nclothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the\nchildren of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,\nfor a statute for ever.\n\n19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven\ndays.\n\n19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the\nseventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third\nday, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.\n\n19:13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and\npurifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that\nsoul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was\nnot sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet\nupon him.\n\n19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into\nthe tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.\n\n19:15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is\nunclean.\n\n19:16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the\nopen fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be\nunclean seven days.\n\n19:17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the\nburnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put\nthereto in a vessel: 19:18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and\ndip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the\nvessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that\ntouched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 19:19 And the\nclean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on\nthe seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and\nwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at\neven.\n\n19:20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,\nthat soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he\nhath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath\nnot been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.\n\n19:21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that\nsprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that\ntoucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.\n\n19:22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and\nthe soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.\n\n20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,\ninto the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in\nKadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.\n\n20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered\nthemselves together against Moses and against Aaron.\n\n20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God\nthat we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!  20:4 And why\nhave ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,\nthat we and our cattle should die there?  20:5 And wherefore have ye\nmade us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?\nit is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;\nneither is there any water to drink.\n\n20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto\nthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon\ntheir faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.\n\n20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, and\ngather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and\nspeak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his\nwater, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so\nthou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.\n\n20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.\n\n20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before\nthe rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch\nyou water out of this rock?  20:11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and\nwith his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out\nabundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.\n\n20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me\nnot, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore\nye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given\nthem.\n\n20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel\nstrove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.\n\n20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,\nThus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath\nbefallen us: 20:15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have\ndwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our\nfathers: 20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,\nand sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and,\nbehold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 20:17\nLet us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass\nthrough the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of\nthe water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not\nturn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy\nborders.\n\n20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come\nout against thee with the sword.\n\n20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high\nway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for\nit: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.\n\n20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out\nagainst him with much people, and with a strong hand.\n\n20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:\nwherefore Israel turned away from him.\n\n20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,\njourneyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.\n\n20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the\ncoast of the land of Edom, saying, 20:24 Aaron shall be gathered unto\nhis people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given\nunto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at\nthe water of Meribah.\n\n20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount\nHor: 20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar\nhis son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die\nthere.\n\n20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount\nHor in the sight of all the congregation.\n\n20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon\nEleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and\nMoses and Eleazar came down from the mount.\n\n20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they\nmourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.\n\n21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard\ntell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against\nIsrael, and took some of them prisoners.\n\n21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt\nindeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy\ntheir cities.\n\n21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up\nthe Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and\nhe called the name of the place Hormah.\n\n21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to\ncompass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much\ndiscouraged because of the way.\n\n21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore\nhave ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there\nis no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this\nlight bread.\n\n21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit\nthe people; and much people of Israel died.\n\n21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for\nwe have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,\nthat he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the\npeople.\n\n21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set\nit upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is\nbitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\n\n21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it\ncame to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the\nserpent of brass, he lived.\n\n21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.\n\n21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the\nwilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.\n\n21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.\n\n21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of\nArnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the\nAmorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the\nAmorites.\n\n21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What\nhe did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the\nstream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth\nupon the border of Moab.\n\n21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the\nLORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give\nthem water.\n\n21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:\n21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,\nby the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the\nwilderness they went to Mattanah: 21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:\nand from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that\nis in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward\nJeshimon.\n\n21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,\nsaying, 21:22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the\nfields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the\nwell: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past\nthy borders.\n\n21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:\nbut Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against\nIsrael into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against\nIsrael.\n\n21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed\nhis land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for\nthe border of the children of Ammon was strong.\n\n21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the\ncities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.\n\n21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who\nhad fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out\nof his hand, even unto Arnon.\n\n21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,\nlet the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 For there is a fire\ngone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed\nAr of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.\n\n21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath\ngiven his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto\nSihon king of the Amorites.\n\n21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and\nwe have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.\n\n21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.\n\n21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages\nthereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.\n\n21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the\nking of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the\nbattle at Edrei.\n\n21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered\nhim into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do\nto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at\nHeshbon.\n\n21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there\nwas none left him alive: and they possessed his land.\n\n22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains\nof Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.\n\n22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the\nAmorites.\n\n22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:\nand Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.\n\n22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company\nlick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of\nthe field.\n\nAnd Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.\n\n22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to\nPethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his\npeople, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from\nEgypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over\nagainst me: 22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this\npeople; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,\nthat we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for\nI wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest\nis cursed.\n\n22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the\nrewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and\nspake unto him the words of Balak.\n\n22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring\nyou word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of\nMoab abode with Balaam.\n\n22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?\n22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,\nhath sent unto me, saying, 22:11 Behold, there is a people come out of\nEgypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them;\nperadventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.\n\n22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou\nshalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.\n\n22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of\nBalak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave\nto go with you.\n\n22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and\nsaid, Balaam refuseth to come with us.\n\n22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than\nthey.\n\n22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the\nson of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto\nme: 22:17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will\ndo whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse\nme this people.\n\n22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If\nBalak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go\nbeyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.\n\n22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I\nmay know what the LORD will say unto me more.\n\n22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men\ncome to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I\nshall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.\n\n22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went\nwith the princes of Moab.\n\n22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of\nthe LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was\nriding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.\n\n22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and\nhis sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,\nand went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into\nthe way.\n\n22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a\nwall being on this side, and a wall on that side.\n\n22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself\nunto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he\nsmote her again.\n\n22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow\nplace, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the\nleft.\n\n22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under\nBalaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a\nstaff.\n\n22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto\nBalaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these\nthree times?  22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast\nmocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I\nkill thee.\n\n22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which\nthou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont\nto do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.\n\n22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of\nthe LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he\nbowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.\n\n22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou\nsmitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand\nthee, because thy way is perverse before me: 22:33 And the ass saw me,\nand turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,\nsurely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.\n\n22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I\nknew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if\nit displease thee, I will get me back again.\n\n22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but\nonly the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So\nBalaam went with the princes of Balak.\n\n22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet\nhim unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in\nthe utmost coast.\n\n22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee\nto call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed\nto promote thee to honour?  22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am\ncome unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word\nthat God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.\n\n22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.\n\n22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the\nprinces that were with him.\n\n22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and\nbrought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see\nthe utmost part of the people.\n\n23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and\nprepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.\n\n23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered\non every altar a bullock and a ram.\n\n23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I\nwill go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he\nsheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.\n\n23:4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven\naltars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.\n\n23:5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto\nBalak, and thus thou shalt speak.\n\n23:6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt\nsacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.\n\n23:7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath\nbrought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,\ncurse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.\n\n23:8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,\nwhom the LORD hath not defied?  23:9 For from the top of the rocks I\nsee him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell\nalone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\n\n23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth\npart of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last\nend be like his!  23:11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou\ndone unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou\nhast blessed them altogether.\n\n23:12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that\nwhich the LORD hath put in my mouth?  23:13 And Balak said unto him,\nCome, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest\nsee them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not\nsee them all: and curse me them from thence.\n\n23:14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of\nPisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on\nevery altar.\n\n23:15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while\nI meet the LORD yonder.\n\n23:16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,\nGo again unto Balak, and say thus.\n\n23:17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,\nand the princes of Moab with him.

Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that\ncurseth thee.\n\n24:10 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his\nhands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse\nmine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these\nthree times.\n\n24:11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee\nunto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.\n\n24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers\nwhich thou sentest unto me, saying, 24:13 If Balak would give me his\nhouse full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of\nthe LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD\nsaith, that will I speak?  24:14 And now, behold, I go unto my people:\ncome therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to\nthy people in the latter days.\n\n24:15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor\nhath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:16 He hath\nsaid, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most\nHigh, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but\nhaving his eyes open: 24:17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall\nbehold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a\nSceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,\nand destroy all the children of Sheth.\n\n24:18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession\nfor his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.\n\n24:19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall\ndestroy him that remaineth of the city.\n\n24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,\nAmalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that\nhe perish for ever.\n\n24:21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,\nStrong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.\n\n24:22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall\ncarry thee away captive.\n\n24:23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when\nGod doeth this!  24:24 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim,\nand shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall\nperish for ever.\n\n24:25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and\nBalak also went his way.\n\n25:1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit\nwhoredom with the daughters of Moab.\n\n25:2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and\nthe people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.\n\n25:3 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the\nLORD was kindled against Israel.\n\n25:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people,\nand hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce\nanger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.\n\n25:5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his\nmen that were joined unto Baalpeor.\n\n25:6 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto\nhis brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the\nsight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were\nweeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n25:7 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the\npriest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a\njavelin in his hand; 25:8 And he went after the man of Israel into the\ntent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the\nwoman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of\nIsrael.\n\n25:9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.\n\n25:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:11 Phinehas, the son\nof Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away\nfrom the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among\nthem, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.\n\n25:12 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:\n25:13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant\nof an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and\nmade an atonement for the children of Israel.\n\n25:14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was\nslain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince\nof a chief house among the Simeonites.\n\n25:15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi,\nthe daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house\nin Midian.\n\n25:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:17 Vex the Midianites,\nand smite them: 25:18 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith\nthey have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of\nCozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was\nslain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.\n\n26:1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto\nMoses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 26:2 Take\nthe sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty\nyears old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are\nable to go to war in Israel.\n\n26:3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of\nMoab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 26:4 Take the sum of the people,\nfrom twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the\nchildren of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.\n\n26:5 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch,\nof whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of\nthe Palluites: 26:6 Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi,\nthe family of the Carmites.\n\n26:7 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were\nnumbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and\nthirty.\n\n26:8 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.\n\n26:9 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram.

he shall not break his word, he shall do according\nto all that proceedeth out of his mouth.\n\n30:3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a\nbond, being in her father's house in her youth; 30:4 And her father\nhear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her\nfather shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and\nevery bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.\n\n30:5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not\nany of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul,\nshall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father\ndisallowed her.\n\n30:6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered\nought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 30:7 And her\nhusband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard\nit: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her\nsoul shall stand.\n\n30:8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;\nthen he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered\nwith her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the\nLORD shall forgive her.\n\n30:9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith\nthey have bound their souls, shall stand against her.\n\n30:10 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a\nbond with an oath;

and they slew all the males.\n\n31:8 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that\nwere slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five\nkings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.\n\n31:9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,\nand their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all\ntheir flocks, and all their goods.\n\n31:10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all\ntheir goodly castles, with fire.\n\n31:11 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and\nof beasts.\n\n31:12 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto\nMoses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the\nchildren of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by\nJordan near Jericho.\n\n31:13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the\ncongregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.\n\n31:14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the\ncaptains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from\nthe battle.\n\n31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?\n31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel\nof Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor,\nand there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.\n\n31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill\nevery woman that hath known man by lying with him.\n\n31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying\nwith him, keep alive for yourselves.\n\n31:19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath\nkilled any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both\nyourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.\n\n31:20 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and\nall work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.\n\n31:21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to\nthe battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded\nMoses; 31:22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the\ntin, and the lead, 31:23 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall\nmake it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it\nshall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth\nnot the fire ye shall make go through the water.\n\n31:24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall\nbe clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.\n\n31:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:26 Take the sum of the\nprey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the\npriest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 31:27 And divide\nthe prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who\nwent out to battle, and between all the congregation: 31:28 And levy a\ntribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one\nsoul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of\nthe asses, and of the sheep: 31:29 Take it of their half, and give it\nunto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.\n\n31:30 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one\nportion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of\nthe flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites,\nwhich keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.\n\n31:31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded\nMoses.\n\n31:32 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war\nhad caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five\nthousand sheep, 31:33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 31:34\nAnd threescore and one thousand asses, 31:35 And thirty and two\nthousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with\nhim.\n\n31:36 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to\nwar, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty\nthousand and five hundred sheep: 31:37 And the LORD's tribute of the\nsheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.\n\n31:38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's\ntribute was threescore and twelve.\n\n31:39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which\nthe LORD's tribute was threescore and one.\n\n31:40 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's\ntribute was thirty and two persons.\n\n31:41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering,\nunto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n31:42 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from\nthe men that warred, 31:43 (Now the half that pertained unto the\ncongregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven\nthousand and five hundred sheep, 31:44 And thirty and six thousand\nbeeves, 31:45 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 31:46 And\nsixteen thousand persons;) 31:47 Even of the children of Israel's\nhalf, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and\ngave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of\nthe LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n31:48 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the\ncaptains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:\n31:49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the\nmen of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man\nof us.\n\n31:50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every\nman hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,\nearrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the\nLORD.\n\n31:51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all\nwrought jewels.\n\n31:52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the\nLORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,\nwas sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.\n\n31:53 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)\n31:54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains\nof thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of\nthe congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the\nLORD.\n\n32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very\ngreat multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and\nthe land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;\n32:2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake\nunto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the\ncongregation, saying, 32:3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah,\nand Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 32:4 Even\nthe country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is\na land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 32:5 Wherefore, said\nthey, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto\nthy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.\n\n32:6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of\nReuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?  32:7\nAnd wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from\ngoing over into the land which the LORD hath given them?  32:8 Thus\ndid your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.\n\n32:9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the\nland, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they\nshould not go into the land which the LORD had given them.\n\n32:10 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,\nsaying, 32:11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from\ntwenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto\nAbraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly\nfollowed me: 32:12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and\nJoshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.\n\n32:13 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made\nthem wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation,\nthat had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.\n\n32:14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase\nof sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward\nIsrael.\n\n32:15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them\nin the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.\n\n32:16 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds\nhere for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 32:17 But we\nourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we\nhave brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in\nthe fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.\n\n32:18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel\nhave inherited every man his inheritance.\n\n32:19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or\nforward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan\neastward.\n\n32:20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will\ngo armed before the LORD to war, 32:21 And will go all of you armed\nover Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from\nbefore him, 32:22 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then\nafterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and\nbefore Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.\n\n32:23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the\nLORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.\n\n32:24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;\nand do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.\n\n32:25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto\nMoses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.\n\n32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,\nshall be there in the cities of Gilead: 32:27 But thy servants will\npass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my\nlord saith.\n\n32:28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and\nJoshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the\nchildren of Israel: 32:29 And Moses said unto them, If the children of\nGad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every\nman armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued\nbefore you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a\npossession: 32:30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they\nshall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.\n\n32:31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,\nsaying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.\n\n32:32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,\nthat the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be\nours.\n\n32:33 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to\nthe children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of\nJoseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of\nOg king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,\neven the cities of the country round about.\n\n32:34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,\n32:35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 32:36 And\nBethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.\n\n32:37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and\nKirjathaim, 32:38 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,)\nand Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.\n\n32:39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,\nand took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.\n\n32:40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he\ndwelt therein.\n\n32:41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns\nthereof, and called them Havothjair.\n\n32:42 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and\ncalled it Nobah, after his own name.\n\n33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went\nforth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of\nMoses and Aaron.\n\n33:2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by\nthe commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to\ntheir goings out.\n\n33:3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the\nfifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the\nchildren of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the\nEgyptians.\n\n33:4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had\nsmitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.\n\n33:5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in\nSuccoth.\n\n33:6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in\nthe edge of the wilderness.\n\n33:7 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,\nwhich is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.\n\n33:8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the\nmidst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in\nthe wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.\n\n33:9 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were\ntwelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees;

and the goings forth of the\nborder shall be to Zedad: 34:9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron,\nand the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your\nnorth border.\n\n34:10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to\nShepham: 34:11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on\nthe east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach\nunto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 34:12 And the border\nshall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt\nsea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.\n\n34:13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the\nland which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give\nunto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 34:14 For the tribe of\nthe children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and\nthe tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their\nfathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of\nManasseh have received their inheritance: 34:15 The two tribes and the\nhalf tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near\nJericho eastward, toward the sunrising.\n\n34:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34:17 These are the names\nof the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest,\nand Joshua the son of Nun.\n\n34:18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land\nby inheritance.\n\n34:19 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb\nthe son of Jephunneh.\n\n34:20 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of\nAmmihud.\n\n34:21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.\n\n34:22 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the\nson of Jogli.\n\n34:23 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the\nchildren of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.\n\n34:24 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel\nthe son of Shiphtan.\n\n34:25 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,\nElizaphan the son of Parnach.\n\n34:26 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel\nthe son of Azzan.\n\n34:27 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the\nson of Shelomi.\n\n34:28 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel\nthe son of Ammihud.\n\n34:29 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance\nunto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.\n\n35:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan\nnear Jericho, saying, 35:2 Command the children of Israel, that they\ngive unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to\ndwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the\ncities round about them.\n\n35:3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of\nthem shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their\nbeasts.\n\n35:4 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the\nLevites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand\ncubits round about.\n\n35:5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two\nthousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the\nwest side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand\ncubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the\nsuburbs of the cities.\n\n35:6 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there\nshall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the\nmanslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty\nand two cities.\n\n35:7 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be\nforty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.\n\n35:8 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of\nthe children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many;\nbut from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of\nhis cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he\ninheriteth.\n\n35:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 35:10 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan\ninto the land of Canaan; 35:11 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be\ncities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which\nkilleth any person at unawares.\n\n35:12 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;\nthat the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in\njudgment.\n\n35:13 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have\nfor refuge.\n\n35:14 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities\nshall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.\n\n35:15 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of\nIsrael, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that\nevery one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.\n\n35:16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die,\nhe is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\n\n35:17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die,\nand he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to\ndeath.\n\n35:18 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may\ndie, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to\ndeath.\n\n35:19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he\nmeeteth him, he shall slay him.\n\n35:20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of\nwait, that he die; 35:21 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he\ndie: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a\nmurderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he\nmeeteth him.\n\n35:22 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon\nhim any thing without laying of wait, 35:23 Or with any stone,\nwherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he\ndie, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 35:24 Then the\ncongregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood\naccording to these judgments: 35:25 And the congregation shall deliver\nthe slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the\ncongregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he\nwas fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest,\nwhich was anointed with the holy oil.\n\n35:26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of\nthe city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 35:27 And the revenger of\nblood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the\nrevenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:\n35:28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until\nthe death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest\nthe slayer shall return into the land of his possession.\n\n35:29 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you\nthroughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n\n35:30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by\nthe mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any\nperson to cause him to die.\n\n35:31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a\nmurderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to\ndeath.\n\n35:32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the\ncity of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land,\nuntil the death of the priest.\n\n35:33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it\ndefileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that\nis shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\n\n35:34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I\ndwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.\n\n36:1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead,\nthe son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of\nJoseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the\nchief fathers of the children of Israel: 36:2 And they said, The LORD\ncommanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the\nchildren of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the\ninheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.\n\n36:3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of\nthe children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the\ninheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the\ntribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot\nof our inheritance.\n\n36:4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then\nshall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe\nwhereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away\nfrom the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.\n\n36:5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word\nof the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.\n\n36:6 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the\ndaughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think\nbest; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they\nmarry.\n\n36:7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove\nfrom tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall\nkeep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.\n\n36:8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe\nof the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the\ntribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man\nthe inheritance of his fathers.\n\n36:9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another\ntribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall\nkeep himself to his own inheritance.\n\n36:10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of\nZelophehad: 36:11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and\nNoah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's\nbrothers' sons: 36:12 And they were married into the families of the\nsons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in\nthe tribe of the family of their father.\n\n36:13 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD\ncommanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the\nplains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fifth Book of Moses:  Called Deuteronomy\n\n\n1:1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side\nJordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,\nbetween Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.\n\n1:2 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount\nSeir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth\nyear, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses\nspake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD\nhad given him in commandment unto them; 1:4 After he had slain Sihon\nthe king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of\nBashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 1:5 On this side Jordan, in\nthe land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 1:6 The\nLORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough\nin this mount: 1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the\nmount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the\nplain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea\nside, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great\nriver, the river Euphrates.\n\n1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land\nwhich the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to\ngive unto them and to their seed after them.\n\n1:9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear\nyou myself alone: 1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,\nbehold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.\n\n1:11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many\nmore as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)  1:12 How can\nI myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?\n1:13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your\ntribes, and I will make them rulers over you.\n\n1:14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is\ngood for us to do.\n\n1:15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made\nthem heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over\nhundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and\nofficers among your tribes.\n\n1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes\nbetween your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his\nbrother, and the stranger that is with him.\n\n1:17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the\nsmall as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;\nfor the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you,\nbring it unto me, and I will hear it.\n\n1:18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should\ndo.\n\n1:19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great\nand terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of\nthe Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to\nKadeshbarnea.\n\n1:20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the\nAmorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.\n\n1:21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and\npossess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear\nnot, neither be discouraged.\n\n1:22 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send\nmen before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us\nword again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall\ncome.\n\n1:23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one\nof a tribe: 1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and\ncame unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.\n\n1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and\nbrought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a\ngood land which the LORD our God doth give us.\n\n1:26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the\ncommandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,\nand said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of\nthe land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to\ndestroy us.\n\n1:28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,\nsaying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great\nand walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the\nAnakims there.\n\n1:29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.\n\n1:30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,\naccording to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 1:31\nAnd in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God\nbare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,\nuntil ye came into this place.\n\n1:32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Who\nwent in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your\ntents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and\nin a cloud by day.\n\n1:34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and\nsware, saying, 1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this\nevil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your\nfathers.\n\n1:36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will\nI give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,\nbecause he hath wholly followed the LORD.\n\n1:37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also\nshalt not go in thither.\n\n1:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall\ngo in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\n\n1:39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and\nyour children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and\nevil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they\nshall possess it.\n\n1:40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the\nwilderness by the way of the Red sea.\n\n1:41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the\nLORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God\ncommanded us.\n\nAnd when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready\nto go up into the hill.\n\n1:42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither\nfight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.\n\n1:43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against\nthe commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.\n\n1:44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against\nyou, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto\nHormah.\n\n1:45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not\nhearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.\n\n1:46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye\nabode there.\n\n2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the\nway of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount\nSeir many days.\n\n2:2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 2:3 Ye have compassed this\nmountain long enough: turn you northward.\n\n2:4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the\ncoast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and\nthey shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves\ntherefore: 2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their\nland, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount\nSeir unto Esau for a possession.\n\n2:6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall\nalso buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.\n\n2:7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy\nhand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these\nforty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked\nnothing.\n\n2:8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,\nwhich dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from\nEziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.\n\n2:9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither\ncontend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land\nfor a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for\na possession.\n\n2:10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,\nand tall, as the Anakims; 2:11 Which also were accounted giants, as\nthe Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.\n\n2:12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of\nEsau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them,\nand dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his\npossession, which the LORD gave unto them.\n\n2:13 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we\nwent over the brook Zered.\n\n2:14 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were\ncome over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the\ngeneration of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as\nthe LORD sware unto them.\n\n2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them\nfrom among the host, until they were consumed.\n\n2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and\ndead from among the people, 2:17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,\n2:18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:\n2:19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,\ndistress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of\nthe land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given\nit unto the children of Lot for a possession.\n\n2:20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein\nin old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 2:21 A people\ngreat, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them\nbefore them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 2:22\nAs he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he\ndestroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and\ndwelt in their stead even unto this day: 2:23 And the Avims which\ndwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth\nout of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)  2:24 Rise\nye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I\nhave given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his\nland: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.\n\n2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of\nthee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear\nreport of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.\n\n2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto\nSihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 2:27 Let me pass\nthrough thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn\nunto the right hand nor to the left.\n\n2:28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me\nwater for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my\nfeet; 2:29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the\nMoabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over\nJordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.\n\n2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the\nLORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that\nhe might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.\n\n2:31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and\nhis land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his\nland.\n\n2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight\nat Jahaz.\n\n2:33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,\nand his sons, and all his people.\n\n2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed\nthe men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left\nnone to remain: 2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto\nourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.\n\n2:36 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from\nthe city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one\ncity too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 2:37\nOnly unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto\nany place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains,\nnor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.\n\n3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of\nBashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.\n\n3:2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him,\nand all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do\nunto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at\nHeshbon.\n\n3:3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of\nBashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to\nhim remaining.\n\n3:4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city\nwhich we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of\nArgob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\n\n3:5 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;\nbeside unwalled towns a great many.\n\n3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of\nHeshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every\ncity.\n\n3:7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a\nprey to ourselves.\n\n3:8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the\nAmorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of\nArnon unto mount Hermon; 3:9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;\nand the Amorites call it Shenir;) 3:10 All the cities of the plain,\nand all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the\nkingdom of Og in Bashan.\n\n3:11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;\nbehold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of\nthe children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four\ncubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.\n\n3:12 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which\nis by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,\ngave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.\n\n3:13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,\ngave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with\nall Bashan, which was called the land of giants.\n\n3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the\ncoasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,\nBashanhavothjair, unto this day.\n\n3:15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.\n\n3:16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead\neven unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto\nthe river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 3:17\nThe plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth\neven unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah\neastward.\n\n3:18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath\ngiven you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before\nyour brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.\n\n3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I\nknow that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I\nhave given you; 3:20 Until the LORD have given rest unto your\nbrethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land\nwhich the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall\nye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.\n\n3:21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen\nall that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall\nthe LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.\n\n3:22 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for\nyou.\n\n3:23 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 3:24 O Lord GOD,\nthou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty\nhand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do\naccording to thy works, and according to thy might?  3:25 I pray thee,\nlet me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that\ngoodly mountain, and Lebanon.\n\n3:26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear\nme: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto\nme of this matter.\n\n3:27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes\nwestward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it\nwith thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\n\n3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he\nshall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit\nthe land which thou shalt see.\n\n3:29 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.\n\n4:1 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the\njudgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go\nin and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.\n\n4:2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall\nye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the\nLORD your God which I command you.\n\n4:3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all\nthe men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them\nfrom among you.\n\n4:4 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one\nof you this day.\n\n4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD\nmy God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to\npossess it.\n\n4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your\nunderstanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these\nstatutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and\nunderstanding people.\n\n4:7 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,\nas the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?  4:8\nAnd what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so\nrighteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?  4:9 Only\ntake heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget\nthe things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy\nheart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons'\nsons; 4:10 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy\nGod in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people\ntogether, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to\nfear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that\nthey may teach their children.\n\n4:11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain\nburned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and\nthick darkness.\n\n4:12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye\nheard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a\nvoice.\n\n4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to\nperform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of\nstone.\n\n4:14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and\njudgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to\npossess it.\n\n4:15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner\nof similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of\nthe midst of the fire: 4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a\ngraven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or\nfemale, 4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the\nlikeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 4:18 The likeness\nof any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish\nthat is in the waters beneath the earth: 4:19 And lest thou lift up\nthine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and\nthe stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship\nthem, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all\nnations under the whole heaven.\n\n4:20 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the\niron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of\ninheritance, as ye are this day.\n\n4:21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware\nthat I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto\nthat good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:\n4:22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye\nshall go over, and possess that good land.\n\n4:23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the\nLORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or\nthe likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.\n\n4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.\n\n4:25 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye\nshall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,\nand make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do\nevil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 4:26 I\ncall heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall\nsoon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to\npossess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly\nbe destroyed.\n\n4:27 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be\nleft few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.\n\n4:28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and\nstone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\n\n4:29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt\nfind him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.\n\n4:30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon\nthee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and\nshalt be obedient unto his voice; 4:31 (For the LORD thy God is a\nmerciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor\nforget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.\n\n4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,\nsince the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the\none side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such\nthing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?  4:33 Did\never people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the\nfire, as thou hast heard, and live?  4:34 Or hath God assayed to go\nand take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by\ntemptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty\nhand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to\nall that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?\n4:35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he\nis God; there is none else beside him.\n\n4:36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might\ninstruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou\nheardest his words out of the midst of the fire.\n\n4:37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed\nafter them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power\nout of Egypt; 4:38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and\nmightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for\nan inheritance, as it is this day.\n\n4:39 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the\nLORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is\nnone else.\n\n4:40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,\nwhich I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with\nthy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon\nthe earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.\n\n4:41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the\nsunrising; 4:42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill\nhis neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that\nfleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 4:43 Namely, Bezer in\nthe wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in\nGilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.\n\n4:44 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of\nIsrael: 4:45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the\njudgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they\ncame forth out of Egypt.\n\n4:46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the\nland of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses\nand the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of\nEgypt: 4:47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of\nBashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan\ntoward the sunrising; 4:48 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the\nriver Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, 4:49 And all the\nplain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain,\nunder the springs of Pisgah.\n\n5:1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,\nthe statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that\nye may learn them, and keep, and do them.\n\n5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.\n\n5:3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,\neven us, who are all of us here alive this day.\n\n5:4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the\nmidst of the fire, 5:5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,\nto shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the\nfire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 5:6 I am the LORD thy\nGod, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of\nbondage.\n\n5:7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.\n\n5:8 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any\nthing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or\nthat is in the waters beneath the earth: 5:9 Thou shalt not bow down\nthyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous\nGod, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the\nthird and fourth generation of them that hate me, 5:10 And shewing\nmercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.\n\n5:11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the\nLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n\n5:12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath\ncommanded thee.\n\n5:13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 5:14 But the\nseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not\ndo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant,\nnor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy\ncattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant\nand thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.\n\n5:15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and\nthat the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand\nand by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee\nto keep the sabbath day.\n\n5:16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath\ncommanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go\nwell with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n\n5:17 Thou shalt not kill.\n\n5:18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.\n\n5:19 Neither shalt thou steal.\n\n5:20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.\n\n5:21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt\nthou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his\nmaidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.\n\n5:22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount\nout of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness,\nwith a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two\ntables of stone, and delivered them unto me.\n\n5:23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of\nthe darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near\nunto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 5:24 And\nye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his\ngreatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire:\nwe have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.\n\n5:25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume\nus: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall\ndie.\n\n5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the\nliving God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and\nlived?  5:27 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall\nsay: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto\nthee; and we will hear it, and do it.\n\n5:28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto\nme; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of\nthis people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all\nthat they have spoken.\n\n5:29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,\nand keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,\nand with their children for ever!  5:30 Go say to them, Get you into\nyour tents again.\n\n5:31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto\nthee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which\nthou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give\nthem to possess it.\n\n5:32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath\ncommanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the\nleft.\n\n5:33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath\ncommanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and\nthat ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.\n\n6:1 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,\nwhich the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them\nin the land whither ye go to possess it: 6:2 That thou mightest fear\nthe LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which\nI command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of\nthy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.\n\n6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be\nwell with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of\nthy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and\nhoney.\n\n6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 6:5 And thou shalt\nlove the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and\nwith all thy might.\n\n6:6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine\nheart: 6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and\nshalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou\nwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\n\n6:8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they\nshall be as frontlets between thine eyes.\n\n6:9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy\ngates.\n\n6:10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee\ninto the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,\nand to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou\nbuildedst not, 6:11 And houses full of all good things, which thou\nfilledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and\nolive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and\nbe full; 6:12 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought\nthee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n\n6:13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear\nby his name.\n\n6:14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which\nare round about you; 6:15 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among\nyou) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and\ndestroy thee from off the face of the earth.\n\n6:16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in\nMassah.\n\n6:17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,\nand his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.\n\n6:18 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of\nthe LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in\nand possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.\n\n6:19 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath\nspoken.\n\n6:20 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean\nthe testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD\nour God hath commanded you?  6:21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We\nwere Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt\nwith a mighty hand: 6:22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great\nand sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before\nour eyes: 6:23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring\nus in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.\n\n6:24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the\nLORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as\nit is at this day.\n\n6:25 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these\ncommandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.\n\n7:1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou\ngoest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the\nHittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,\nand the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations\ngreater and mightier than thou; 7:2 And when the LORD thy God shall\ndeliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy\nthem; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:\n7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou\nshalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy\nson.\n\n7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may\nserve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against\nyou, and destroy thee suddenly.\n\n7:5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,\nand break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their\ngraven images with fire.\n\n7:6 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy\nGod hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all\npeople that are upon the face of the earth.\n\n7:7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye\nwere more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all\npeople: 7:8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep\nthe oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought\nyou out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of\nbondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\n\n7:9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,\nwhich keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his\ncommandments to a thousand generations; 7:10 And repayeth them that\nhate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him\nthat hateth him, he will repay him to his face.\n\n7:11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and\nthe judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.\n\n7:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these\njudgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep\nunto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:\n7:13 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will\nalso bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn,\nand thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks\nof thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give\nthee.\n\n7:14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male\nor female barren among you, or among your cattle.\n\n7:15 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put\nnone of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but\nwill lay them upon all them that hate thee.\n\n7:16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God\nshall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither\nshalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.\n\n7:17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;\nhow can I dispossess them?  7:18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but\nshalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto\nall Egypt; 7:19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the\nsigns, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out\narm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy\nGod do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.\n\n7:20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until\nthey that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.\n\n7:21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is\namong you, a mighty God and terrible.\n\n7:22 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by\nlittle and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the\nbeasts of the field increase upon thee.\n\n7:23 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall\ndestroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.\n\n7:24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt\ndestroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to\nstand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.\n\n7:25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou\nshalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto\nthee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD\nthy God.\n\n7:26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest\nthou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and\nthou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.\n\n8:1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye\nobserve to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess\nthe land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.\n\n8:2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led\nthee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove\nthee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his\ncommandments, or no.\n\n8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee\nwith manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that\nhe might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by\nevery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.\n\n8:4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,\nthese forty years.\n\n8:5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth\nhis son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.\n\n8:6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to\nwalk in his ways, and to fear him.\n\n8:7 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of\nbrooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys\nand hills; 8:8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees,\nand pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 8:9 A land wherein\nthou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing\nin it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou\nmayest dig brass.\n\n8:10 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD\nthy God for the good land which he hath given thee.\n\n8:11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his\ncommandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command\nthee this day: 8:12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast\nbuilt goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 8:13 And when thy herds and\nthy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and\nall that thou hast is multiplied; 8:14 Then thine heart be lifted up,\nand thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the\nland of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 8:15 Who led thee through\nthat great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and\nscorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee\nforth water out of the rock of flint; 8:16 Who fed thee in the\nwilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might\nhumble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy\nlatter end; 8:17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might\nof mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.\n\n8:18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that\ngiveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant\nwhich he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.\n\n8:19 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and\nwalk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify\nagainst you this day that ye shall surely perish.\n\n8:20 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so\nshall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of\nthe LORD your God.\n\n9:1 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to\npossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and\nfenced up to heaven, 9:2 A people great and tall, the children of the\nAnakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can\nstand before the children of Anak!  9:3 Understand therefore this day,\nthat the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a\nconsuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down\nbefore thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them\nquickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.\n\n9:4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath\ncast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD\nhath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of\nthese nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.\n\n9:5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,\ndost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these\nnations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and\nthat he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n\n9:6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this\ngood land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a\nstiffnecked people.\n\n9:7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to\nwrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of\nthe land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been\nrebellious against the LORD.\n\n9:8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was\nangry with you to have destroyed you.\n\n9:9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,\neven the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I\nabode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat\nbread nor drink water: 9:10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables\nof stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written\naccording to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount\nout of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.\n\n9:11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,\nthat the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the\ncovenant.\n\n9:12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from\nhence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have\ncorrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way\nwhich I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.\n\n9:13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this\npeople, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 9:14 Let me alone,\nthat I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven:\nand I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.\n\n9:15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned\nwith fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.\n\n9:16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your\nGod, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out\nof the way which the LORD had commanded you.\n\n9:17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and\nbrake them before your eyes.\n\n9:18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and\nforty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all\nyour sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD,\nto provoke him to anger.\n\n9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the\nLORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto\nme at that time also.\n\n9:20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and\nI prayed for Aaron also the same time.\n\n9:21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it\nwith fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was\nas small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that\ndescended out of the mount.\n\n9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye\nprovoked the LORD to wrath.\n\n9:23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up\nand possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against\nthe commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor\nhearkened to his voice.\n\n9:24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew\nyou.\n\n9:25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as\nI fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy\nyou.\n\n9:26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy\nnot thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through\nthy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a\nmighty hand.\n\n9:27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto\nthe stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their\nsin: 9:28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the\nLORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them,\nand because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in\nthe wilderness.\n\n9:29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou\nbroughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.\n\n10:1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone\nlike unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee\nan ark of wood.\n\n10:2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first\ntables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.\n\n10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone\nlike unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables\nin mine hand.\n\n10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the\nten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of\nthe midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave\nthem unto me.\n\n10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the\ntables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD\ncommanded me.\n\n10:6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the\nchildren of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was\nburied; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his\nstead.\n\n10:7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to\nJotbath, a land of rivers of waters.\n\n10:8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the\nark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister\nunto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.\n\n10:9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;\nthe LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised\nhim.\n\n10:10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty\ndays and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time\nalso, and the LORD would not destroy thee.\n\n10:11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the\npeople, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto\ntheir fathers to give unto them.\n\n10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but\nto fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,\nand to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy\nsoul, 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,\nwhich I command thee this day for thy good?  10:14 Behold, the heaven\nand the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with\nall that therein is.\n\n10:15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he\nchose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this\nday.\n\n10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more\nstiffnecked.\n\n10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great\nGod, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh\nreward: 10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and\nwidow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.\n\n10:19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the\nland of Egypt.\n\n10:20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to\nhim shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.\n\n10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee\nthese great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.\n\n10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten\npersons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of\nheaven for multitude.\n\n11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,\nand his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.\n\n11:2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which\nhave not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD\nyour God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,\n11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of\nEgypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 11:4 And\nwhat he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their\nchariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as\nthey pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this\nday; 11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came\ninto this place; 11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons\nof Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and\nswallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the\nsubstance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:\n11:7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he\ndid.\n\n11:8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you\nthis day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,\nwhither ye go to possess it; 11:9 And that ye may prolong your days in\nthe land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and\nto their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.\n\n11:10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the\nland of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,\nand wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 11:11 But the\nland, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and\ndrinketh water of the rain of heaven: 11:12 A land which the LORD thy\nGod careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from\nthe beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.\n\n11:13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto\nmy commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your\nGod, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,\n11:14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,\nthe first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy\ncorn, and thy wine, and thine oil.\n\n11:15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou\nmayest eat and be full.\n\n11:16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye\nturn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 11:17 And then the\nLORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that\nthere be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye\nperish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.\n\n11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in\nyour soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be\nas frontlets between your eyes.\n\n11:19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when\nthou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when\nthou liest down, and when thou risest up.\n\n11:20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,\nand upon thy gates: 11:21 That your days may be multiplied, and the\ndays of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your\nfathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.\n\n11:22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I\ncommand you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his\nways, and to cleave unto him; 11:23 Then will the LORD drive out all\nthese nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations\nand mightier than yourselves.\n\n11:24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be\nyours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river\nEuphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.\n\n11:25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD\nyour God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the\nland that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.\n\n11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 11:27\nA blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I\ncommand you this day: 11:28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the\ncommandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which\nI command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not\nknown.\n\n11:29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought\nthee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou\nshalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount\nEbal.\n\n11:30 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun\ngoeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the\nchampaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?  11:31 For\nye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD\nyour God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.\n\n11:32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which\nI set before you this day.\n\n12:1 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to\ndo in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to\npossess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.\n\n12:2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations\nwhich ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and\nupon the hills, and under every green tree: 12:3 And ye shall\noverthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves\nwith fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and\ndestroy the names of them out of that place.\n\n12:4 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.\n\n12:5 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of\nall your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall\nye seek, and thither thou shalt come: 12:6 And thither ye shall bring\nyour burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave\nofferings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings,\nand the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 12:7 And there ye\nshall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that\nye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy\nGod hath blessed thee.\n\n12:8 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,\nevery man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.\n\n12:9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,\nwhich the LORD your God giveth you.\n\n12:10 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD\nyour God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all\nyour enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 12:11 Then there\nshall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his\nname to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you;\nyour burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave\noffering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the\nLORD: 12:12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and\nyour sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your\nmaidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as\nhe hath no part nor inheritance with you.\n\n12:13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in\nevery place that thou seest: 12:14 But in the place which the LORD\nshall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt\nofferings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.\n\n12:15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,\nwhatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the\nLORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may\neat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.\n\n12:16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth\nas water.\n\n12:17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or\nof thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy\nflock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill\nofferings, or heave offering of thine hand: 12:18 But thou must eat\nthem before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall\nchoose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and\nthy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou\nshalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine\nhands unto.\n\n12:19 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as\nthou livest upon the earth.\n\n12:20 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath\npromised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul\nlongeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul\nlusteth after.\n\n12:21 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name\nthere be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of\nthy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee,\nand thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.\n\n12:22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat\nthem: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.\n\n12:23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the\nlife; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.\n\n12:24 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as\nwater.\n\n12:25 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with\nthy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the\nsight of the LORD.\n\n12:26 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt\ntake, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: 12:27 And\nthou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon\nthe altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall\nbe poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat\nthe flesh.\n\n12:28 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it\nmay go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when\nthou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy\nGod.\n\n12:29 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before\nthee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them,\nand dwellest in their land; 12:30 Take heed to thyself that thou be\nnot snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before\nthee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did\nthese nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.\n\n12:31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every\nabomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their\ngods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the\nfire to their gods.\n\n12:32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt\nnot add thereto, nor diminish from it.\n\n13:1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and\ngiveth thee a sign or a wonder, 13:2 And the sign or the wonder come\nto pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other\ngods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 13:3 Thou\nshalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of\ndreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the\nLORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\n\n13:4 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his\ncommandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave\nunto him.\n\n13:5 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to\ndeath; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God,\nwhich brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of\nthe house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy\nGod commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from\nthe midst of thee.\n\n13:6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy\ndaughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine\nown soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other\ngods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 13:7 Namely,\nof the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee,\nor far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the\nother end of the earth; 13:8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor\nhearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou\nspare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 13:9 But thou shalt surely kill\nhim; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and\nafterwards the hand of all the people.\n\n13:10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he\nhath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought\nthee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n\n13:11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any\nsuch wickedness as this is among you.\n\n13:12 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy\nGod hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 13:13 Certain men, the\nchildren of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn\nthe inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,\nwhich ye have not known; 13:14 Then shalt thou enquire, and make\nsearch, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing\ncertain, that such abomination is wrought among you; 13:15 Thou shalt\nsurely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword,\ndestroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle\nthereof, with the edge of the sword.\n\n13:16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the\nstreet thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil\nthereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for\never; it shall not be built again.\n\n13:17 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:\nthat the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee\nmercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath\nsworn unto thy fathers; 13:18 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of\nthe LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee\nthis day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.\n\n14:1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut\nyourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.\n\n14:2 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD\nhath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the\nnations that are upon the earth.\n\n14:3 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.\n\n14:4 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and\nthe goat, 14:5 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the\nwild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.\n\n14:6 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft\ninto two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall\neat.\n\n14:7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or\nof them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and\nthe coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore\nthey are unclean unto you.\n\n14:8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the\ncud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor\ntouch their dead carcase.\n\n14:9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have\nfins and scales shall ye eat: 14:10 And whatsoever hath not fins and\nscales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.\n\n14:11 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.\n\n14:12 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the\nossifrage, and the ospray, 14:13 And the glede, and the kite, and the\nvulture after his kind, 14:14 And every raven after his kind, 14:15\nAnd the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after\nhis kind, 14:16 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 14:17\nAnd the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 14:18 And the\nstork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\n\n14:19 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they\nshall not be eaten.\n\n14:20 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.\n\n14:21 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt\ngive it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or\nthou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto\nthe LORD thy God.\n\nThou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.\n\n14:22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the\nfield bringeth forth year by year.\n\n14:23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which\nhe shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy\nwine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy\nflocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.\n\n14:24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able\nto carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy\nGod shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath\nblessed thee: 14:25 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up\nthe money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD\nthy God shall choose: 14:26 And thou shalt bestow that money for\nwhatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for\nwine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and\nthou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice,\nthou, and thine household, 14:27 And the Levite that is within thy\ngates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance\nwith thee.\n\n14:28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe\nof thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:\n14:29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with\nthee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are\nwithin thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the\nLORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou\ndoest.\n\n15:1 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.\n\n15:2 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that\nlendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact\nit of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the\nLORD's release.\n\n15:3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is\nthine with thy brother thine hand shall release; 15:4 Save when there\nshall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in\nthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to\npossess it: 15:5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the\nLORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command\nthee this day.\n\n15:6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou\nshalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou\nshalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.\n\n15:7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within\nany of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou\nshalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor\nbrother: 15:8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt\nsurely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.\n\n15:9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying,\nThe seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be\nevil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry\nunto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.\n\n15:10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved\nwhen thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy\nGod shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest\nthine hand unto.\n\n15:11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I\ncommand thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy\nbrother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.\n\n15:12 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold\nunto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou\nshalt let him go free from thee.\n\n15:13 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let\nhim go away empty: 15:14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy\nflock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that\nwherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.\n\n15:15 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of\nEgypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee\nthis thing to day.\n\n15:16 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from\nthee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with\nthee; 15:17 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear\nunto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy\nmaidservant thou shalt do likewise.\n\n15:18 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away\nfree from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee,\nin serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in\nall that thou doest.\n\n15:19 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock\nthou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with\nthe firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.\n\n15:20 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the\nplace which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.\n\n15:21 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind,\nor have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy\nGod.\n\n15:22 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean\nperson shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.\n\n15:23 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it\nupon the ground as water.\n\n16:1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD\nthy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth\nout of Egypt by night.\n\n16:2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy\nGod, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall\nchoose to place his name there.\n\n16:3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou\neat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou\ncamest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest\nremember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all\nthe days of thy life.\n\n16:4 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy\ncoast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which\nthou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the\nmorning.\n\n16:5 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates,\nwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee: 16:6 But at the place which the\nLORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt\nsacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the\nseason that thou camest forth out of Egypt.\n\n16:7 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy\nGod shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy\ntents.\n\n16:8 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day\nshall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work\ntherein.\n\n16:9 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the\nseven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the\ncorn.\n\n16:10 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God\nwith a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt\ngive unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed\nthee: 16:11 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and\nthy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant,\nand the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the\nfatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the\nLORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.\n\n16:12 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and\nthou shalt observe and do these statutes.\n\n16:13 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after\nthat thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 16:14 And thou shalt\nrejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy\nmanservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the\nfatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.\n\n16:15 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God\nin the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God\nshall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine\nhands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.\n\n16:16 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD\nthy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened\nbread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and\nthey shall not appear before the LORD empty: 16:17 Every man shall\ngive as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God\nwhich he hath given thee.\n\n16:18 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which\nthe LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall\njudge the people with just judgment.\n\n16:19 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,\nneither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and\npervert the words of the righteous.\n\n16:20 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou\nmayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n\n16:21 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the\naltar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.\n\n16:22 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God\nhateth.\n\n17:1 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or\nsheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an\nabomination unto the LORD thy God.\n\n17:2 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the\nLORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness\nin the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, 17:3\nAnd hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the\nsun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not\ncommanded; 17:4 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and\nenquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,\nthat such abomination is wrought in Israel: 17:5 Then shalt thou bring\nforth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing,\nunto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with\nstones, till they die.\n\n17:6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that\nis worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he\nshall not be put to death.\n\n17:7 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to\ndeath, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put\nthe evil away from among you.\n\n17:8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between\nblood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke,\nbeing matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise,\nand get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;\n17:9 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the\njudge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew\nthee the sentence of judgment: 17:10 And thou shalt do according to\nthe sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose\nshall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that\nthey inform thee: 17:11 According to the sentence of the law which\nthey shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall\ntell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence\nwhich they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.\n\n17:12 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken\nunto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy\nGod, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put\naway the evil from Israel.\n\n17:13 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more\npresumptuously.\n\n17:14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth\nthee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I\nwill set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;\n17:15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy\nGod shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over\nthee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy\nbrother.\n\n17:16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the\npeople to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses:\nforasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return\nno more that way.\n\n17:17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn\nnot away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and\ngold.\n\n17:18 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,\nthat he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which\nis before the priests the Levites: 17:19 And it shall be with him, and\nhe shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to\nfear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these\nstatutes, to do them: 17:20 That his heart be not lifted up above his\nbrethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the\nright hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in\nhis kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.\n\n18:1 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no\npart nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the\nLORD made by fire, and his inheritance.\n\n18:2 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:\nthe LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.\n\n18:3 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them\nthat offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give\nunto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.\n\n18:4 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil,\nand the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.\n\n18:5 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to\nstand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.\n\n18:6 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,\nwhere he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the\nplace which the LORD shall choose; 18:7 Then he shall minister in the\nname of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which\nstand there before the LORD.\n\n18:8 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of\nthe sale of his patrimony.\n\n18:9 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth\nthee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those\nnations.\n\n18:10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son\nor his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or\nan observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.\n\n18:11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard,\nor a necromancer.\n\n18:12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:\nand because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out\nfrom before thee.\n\n18:13 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.\n\n18:14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto\nobservers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy\nGod hath not suffered thee so to do.\n\n18:15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the\nmidst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall\nhearken; 18:16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy\nGod in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again\nthe voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any\nmore, that I die not.\n\n18:17 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they\nhave spoken.\n\n18:18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like\nunto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto\nthem all that I shall command him.\n\n18:19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto\nmy words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.\n\n18:20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name,\nwhich I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the\nname of other gods, even that prophet shall die.\n\n18:21 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which\nthe LORD hath not spoken?  18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the name\nof the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the\nthing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it\npresumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.\n\n19:1 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the\nLORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in\ntheir cities, and in their houses; 19:2 Thou shalt separate three\ncities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God\ngiveth thee to possess it.\n\n19:3 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land,\nwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that\nevery slayer may flee thither.\n\n19:4 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,\nthat he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he\nhated not in time past; 19:5 As when a man goeth into the wood with\nhis neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe\nto cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and\nlighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of\nthose cities, and live: 19:6 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the\nslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is\nlong, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he\nhated him not in time past.\n\n19:7 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three\ncities for thee.\n\n19:8 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto\nthy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto\nthy fathers; 19:9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do\nthem, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to\nwalk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee,\nbeside these three: 19:10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land,\nwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be\nupon thee.\n\n19:11 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and\nrise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth\ninto one of these cities: 19:12 Then the elders of his city shall send\nand fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of\nblood, that he may die.\n\n19:13 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt\nof innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.\n\n19:14 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of\nold time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in\nthe land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.\n\n19:15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or\nfor any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two\nwitnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be\nestablished.\n\n19:16 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against\nhim that which is wrong; 19:17 Then both the men, between whom the\ncontroversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and\nthe judges, which shall be in those days; 19:18 And the judges shall\nmake diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false\nwitness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; 19:19 Then\nshall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother:\nso shalt thou put the evil away from among you.\n\n19:20 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall\nhenceforth commit no more any such evil among you.\n\n19:21 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye\nfor eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\n\n20:1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest\nhorses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of\nthem: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of\nthe land of Egypt.\n\n20:2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the\npriest shall approach and speak unto the people, 20:3 And shall say\nunto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against\nyour enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble,\nneither be ye terrified because of them; 20:4 For the LORD your God is\nhe that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save\nyou.\n\n20:5 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is\nthere that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him\ngo and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man\ndedicate it.\n\n20:6 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet\neaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in\nthe battle, and another man eat of it.\n\n20:7 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not\ntaken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the\nbattle, and another man take her.\n\n20:8 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they\nshall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him\ngo and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well\nas his heart.\n\n20:9 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking\nunto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead\nthe people.\n\n20:10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then\nproclaim peace unto it.\n\n20:11 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto\nthee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein\nshall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.\n\n20:12 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war\nagainst thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 20:13 And when the LORD thy\nGod hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male\nthereof with the edge of the sword: 20:14 But the women, and the\nlittle ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the\nspoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the\nspoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.\n\n20:15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off\nfrom thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.\n\n20:16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth\ngive thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that\nbreatheth: 20:17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the\nHittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the\nHivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:\n20:18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,\nwhich they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the\nLORD your God.\n\n20:19 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war\nagainst it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by\nforcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou\nshalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to\nemploy them in the siege: 20:20 Only the trees which thou knowest that\nthey be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and\nthou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,\nuntil it be subdued.\n\n21:1 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth\nthee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath\nslain him: 21:2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and\nthey shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is\nslain: 21:3 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the\nslain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which\nhath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 21:4\nAnd the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough\nvalley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the\nheifer's neck there in the valley: 21:5 And the priests the sons of\nLevi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to\nminister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their\nword shall every controversy and every stroke be tried: 21:6 And all\nthe elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash\ntheir hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 21:7 And\nthey shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither\nhave our eyes seen it.\n\n21:8 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast\nredeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's\ncharge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.\n\n21:9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among\nyou, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.\n\n21:10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD\nthy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them\ncaptive, 21:11 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and\nhast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 21:12\nThen thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave her\nhead, and pare her nails; 21:13 And she shall put the raiment of her\ncaptivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail\nher father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go\nin unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.\n\n21:14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt\nlet her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for\nmoney, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast\nhumbled her.\n\n21:15 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and\nthey have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if\nthe firstborn son be hers that was hated: 21:16 Then it shall be, when\nhe maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make\nthe son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is\nindeed the firstborn: 21:17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the\nhated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he\nhath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the\nfirstborn is his.\n\n21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey\nthe voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when\nthey have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 21:19 Then shall\nhis father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the\nelders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 21:20 And they\nshall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and\nrebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a\ndrunkard.\n\n21:21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he\ndie: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall\nhear, and fear.\n\n21:22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to\nbe put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 21:23 His body shall not\nremain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him\nthat day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be\nnot defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.\n\n22:1 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and\nhide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto\nthy brother.\n\n22:2 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him\nnot, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be\nwith thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it\nto him again.\n\n22:3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do\nwith his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he\nhath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest\nnot hide thyself.\n\n22:4 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the\nway, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift\nthem up again.\n\n22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,\nneither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are\nabomination unto the LORD thy God.\n\n22:6 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree,\nor on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam\nsitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam\nwith the young: 22:7 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and\ntake the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou\nmayest prolong thy days.\n\n22:8 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement\nfor thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man\nfall from thence.\n\n22:9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit\nof thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be\ndefiled.\n\n22:10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.\n\n22:11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and\nlinen together.\n\n22:12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy\nvesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.\n\n22:13 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 22:14\nAnd give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name\nupon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found\nher not a maid: 22:15 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her\nmother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto\nthe elders of the city in the gate: 22:16 And the damsel's father\nshall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife,\nand he hateth her; 22:17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech\nagainst her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these\nare the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the\ncloth before the elders of the city.\n\n22:18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise\nhim; 22:19 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver,\nand give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought\nup an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he\nmay not put her away all his days.\n\n22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not\nfound for the damsel: 22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to\nthe door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone\nher with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in\nIsrael, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put\nevil away from among you.\n\n22:22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then\nthey shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and\nthe woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.\n\n22:23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a\nman find her in the city, and lie with her; 22:24 Then ye shall bring\nthem both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with\nstones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the\ncity; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so\nthou shalt put away evil from among you.\n\n22:25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man\nforce her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall\ndie.\n\n22:26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the\ndamsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his\nneighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: 22:27 For he found\nher in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none\nto save her.\n\n22:28 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed,\nand lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

because thou wouldest not obey the voice of\nthe LORD thy God.\n\n28:63 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to\ndo you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to\ndestroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from\noff the land whither thou goest to possess it.\n\n28:64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one\nend of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other\ngods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and\nstone.\n\n28:65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall\nthe sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a\ntrembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 28:66 And\nthy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and\nnight, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 28:67 In the morning\nthou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say,\nWould God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou\nshalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.\n\n28:68 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by\nthe way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again:\nand there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and\nbondwomen, and no man shall buy you.\n\n29:1 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded\nMoses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside\nthe covenant which he made with them in Horeb.\n\n29:2 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have\nseen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto\nPharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; 29:3 The\ngreat temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those\ngreat miracles: 29:4 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to\nperceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.\n\n29:5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes\nare not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy\nfoot.\n\n29:6 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong\ndrink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.\n\n29:7 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and\nOg the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote\nthem: 29:8 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto\nthe Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.\n\n29:9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye\nmay prosper in all that ye do.\n\n29:10 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your\ncaptains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the\nmen of Israel, 29:11 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger\nthat is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy\nwater: 29:12 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy\nGod, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this\nday: 29:13 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto\nhimself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto\nthee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and\nto Jacob.\n\n29:14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;\n29:15 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD\nour God, and also with him that is not here with us this day: 29:16\n(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came\nthrough the nations which ye passed by; 29:17 And ye have seen their\nabominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which\nwere among them:) 29:18 Lest there should be among you man, or woman,\nor family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD\nour God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should\nbe among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; 29:19 And it come\nto pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless\nhimself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the\nimagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: 29:20 The\nLORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his\njealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are\nwritten in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out\nhis name from under heaven.\n\n29:21 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes\nof Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are\nwritten in this book of the law: 29:22 So that the generation to come\nof your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that\nshall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of\nthat land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; 29:23\nAnd that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,\nthat it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like\nthe overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the\nLORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 29:24 Even all nations\nshall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what\nmeaneth the heat of this great anger?  29:25 Then men shall say,\nBecause they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their\nfathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the\nland of Egypt: 29:26 For they went and served other gods, and\nworshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given\nunto them: 29:27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this\nland, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:\n29:28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in\nwrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as\nit is this day.\n\n29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things\nwhich are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that\nwe may do all the words of this law.\n\n30:1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon\nthee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and\nthou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD\nthy God hath driven thee, 30:2 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God,\nand shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this\nday, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy\nsoul; 30:3 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and\nhave compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all\nthe nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.\n\n30:4 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,\nfrom thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he\nfetch thee: 30:5 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land\nwhich thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do\nthee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.\n\n30:6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart\nof thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with\nall thy soul, that thou mayest live.\n\n30:7 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine\nenemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.\n\n30:8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all\nhis commandments which I command thee this day.\n\n30:9 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of\nthine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle,\nand in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again\nrejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 30:10 If\nthou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his\ncommandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the\nlaw, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and\nwith all thy soul.\n\n30:11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not\nhidden from thee, neither is it far off.\n\n30:12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up\nfor us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do\nit?  30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who\nshall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear\nit, and do it?  30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy\nmouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.\n\n30:15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death\nand evil; 30:16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy\nGod, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his\nstatutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and\nthe LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to\npossess it.\n\n30:17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but\nshalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 30:18 I\ndenounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye\nshall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over\nJordan to go to possess it.\n\n30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I\nhave set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore\nchoose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 30:20 That thou\nmayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and\nthat thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length\nof thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware\nunto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.\n\n31:1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.\n\n31:2 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this\nday; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto\nme, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\n\n31:3 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will\ndestroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them:\nand Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.\n\n31:4 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,\nkings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.\n\n31:5 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do\nunto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded\nyou.\n\n31:6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:\nfor the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not\nfail thee, nor forsake thee.\n\n31:7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of\nall Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with\nthis people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers\nto give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.\n\n31:8 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with\nthee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither\nbe dismayed.\n\n31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the\nsons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto\nall the elders of Israel.\n\n31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven\nyears, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of\ntabernacles, 31:11 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD\nthy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law\nbefore all Israel in their hearing.\n\n31:12 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy\nstranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they\nmay learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words\nof this law: 31:13 And that their children, which have not known any\nthing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye\nlive in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.\n\n31:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that\nthou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle\nof the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and\nJoshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n31:15 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:\nand the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.\n\n31:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy\nfathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods\nof the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and\nwill forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.\n\n31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I\nwill forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall\nbe devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that\nthey will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because\nour God is not among us?  31:18 And I will surely hide my face in that\nday for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are\nturned unto other gods.\n\n31:19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the\nchildren of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a\nwitness for me against the children of Israel.\n\n31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware\nunto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall\nhave eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn\nunto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my\ncovenant.\n\n31:21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are\nbefallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;\nfor it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I\nknow their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have\nbrought them into the land which I sware.\n\n31:22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the\nchildren of Israel.\n\n31:23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong\nand of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel\ninto the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.\n\n31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the\nwords of this law in a book, until they were finished, 31:25 That\nMoses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the\nLORD, saying, 31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side\nof the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there\nfor a witness against thee.\n\n31:27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am\nyet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD;\nand how much more after my death?  31:28 Gather unto me all the elders\nof your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in\ntheir ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.\n\n31:29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt\nyourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;\nand evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil\nin the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of\nyour hands.\n\n31:30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel\nthe words of this song, until they were ended.\n\n32:1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the\nwords of my mouth.\n\n32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the\ndew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon\nthe grass: 32:3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe\nye greatness unto our God.\n\n32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are\njudgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.\n\n32:5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his\nchildren: they are a perverse and crooked generation.\n\n32:6 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not\nhe thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and\nestablished thee?  32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the years\nof many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy\nelders, and they will tell thee.\n\n32:8 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when\nhe separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people\naccording to the number of the children of Israel.\n\n32:9 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his\ninheritance.\n\n32:10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling\nwilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the\napple of his eye.\n\n32:11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,\nspreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:\n32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god\nwith him.\n\n32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might\neat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of\nthe rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 32:14 Butter of kine, and\nmilk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and\ngoats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure\nblood of the grape.\n\n32:15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art\ngrown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which\nmade him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.\n\n32:16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with\nabominations provoked they him to anger.\n\n32:17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew\nnot, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.\n\n32:18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast\nforgotten God that formed thee.\n\n32:19 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the\nprovoking of his sons, and of his daughters.\n\n32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what\ntheir end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children\nin whom is no faith.\n\n32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they\nhave provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to\njealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to\nanger with a foolish nation.\n\n32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\nlowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on\nfire the foundations of the mountains.\n\n32:23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon\nthem.\n\n32:24 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\nand with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon\nthem, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n\n32:25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the\nyoung man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray\nhairs.\n\n32:26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the\nremembrance of them to cease from among men: 32:27 Were it not that I\nfeared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave\nthemselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and\nthe LORD hath not done all this.\n\n32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any\nunderstanding in them.\n\n32:29 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they\nwould consider their latter end!  32:30 How should one chase a\nthousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had\nsold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  32:31 For their rock is not\nas our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.\n\n32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of\nGomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:\n32:33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of\nasps.\n\n32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my\ntreasures?  32:35 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot\nshall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and\nthe things that shall come upon them make haste.\n\n32:36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his\nservants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none\nshut up, or left.\n\n32:37 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they\ntrusted, 32:38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank\nthe wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and\nbe your protection.\n\n32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I\nkill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that\ncan deliver out of my hand.\n\n32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.\n\n32:41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on\njudgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward\nthem that hate me.\n\n32:42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall\ndevour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the\ncaptives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.\n\n32:43 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the\nblood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,\nand will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.\n\n32:44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears\nof the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.\n\n32:45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:\n32:46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which\nI testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to\nobserve to do, all the words of this law.\n\n32:47 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and\nthrough this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye\ngo over Jordan to possess it.\n\n32:48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 32:49\nGet thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in\nthe land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of\nCanaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:\n32:50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto\nthy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered\nunto his people: 32:51 Because ye trespassed against me among the\nchildren of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness\nof Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of\nIsrael.\n\n32:52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go\nthither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.\n\n33:1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed\nthe children of Israel before his death.\n\n33:2 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto\nthem; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands\nof saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.\n\n33:3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and\nthey sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.\n\n33:4 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the\ncongregation of Jacob.\n\n33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the\ntribes of Israel were gathered together.\n\n33:6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.\n\n33:7 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the\nvoice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be\nsufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.\n\n33:8 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy\nholy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst\nstrive at the waters of Meribah; 33:9 Who said unto his father and to\nhis mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his\nbrethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word,\nand kept thy covenant.\n\n33:10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they\nshall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine\naltar.\n\n33:11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;\nsmite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them\nthat hate him, that they rise not again.\n\n33:12 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in\nsafety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he\nshall dwell between his shoulders.\n\n33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the\nprecious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth\nbeneath, 33:14 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,\nand for the precious things put forth by the moon, 33:15 And for the\nchief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of\nthe lasting hills, 33:16 And for the precious things of the earth and\nfulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:\nlet the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the\nhead of him that was separated from his brethren.\n\n33:17 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns\nare like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people\ntogether to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of\nEphraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.\n\n33:18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,\nIssachar, in thy tents.\n\n33:19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall\noffer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the\nabundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.\n\n33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he\ndwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.\n\n33:21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a\nportion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of\nthe people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments\nwith Israel.\n\n33:22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from\nBashan.\n\n33:23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and\nfull with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the\nsouth.\n\n33:24 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let\nhim be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.\n\n33:25 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy\nstrength be.\n\n33:26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the\nheaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.\n\n33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the\neverlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;\nand shall say, Destroy them.\n\n33:28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob\nshall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop\ndown dew.\n\n33:29 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved\nby the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy\nexcellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou\nshalt tread upon their high places.\n\n34:1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of\nNebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD\nshewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 34:2 And all Naphtali,\nand the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto\nthe utmost sea, 34:3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of\nJericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.\n\n34:4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto\nAbraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy\nseed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not\ngo over thither.\n\n34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,\naccording to the word of the LORD.\n\n34:6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against\nBethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\n\n34:7 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his\neye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.\n\n34:8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab\nthirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.\n\n34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for\nMoses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel\nhearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n34:10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,\nwhom the LORD knew face to face, 34:11 In all the signs and the\nwonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to\nPharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 34:12 And in\nall that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed\nin the sight of all Israel.\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of Joshua\n\n\n1:1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to\npass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister,\nsaying, 1:2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over\nthis Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give\nto them, even to the children of Israel.\n\n1:3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have\nI given unto you, as I said unto Moses.\n\n1:4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,\nthe river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great\nsea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.\n\n1:5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days\nof thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not\nfail thee, nor forsake thee.\n\n1:6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou\ndivide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers\nto give them.\n\n1:7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe\nto do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:\nturn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest\nprosper withersoever thou goest.\n\n1:8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou\nshalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do\naccording to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy\nway prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\n\n1:9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not\nafraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee\nwhithersoever thou goest.\n\n1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 1:11\nPass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you\nvictuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go\nin to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess\nit.\n\n1:12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe\nof Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 1:13 Remember the word which Moses\nthe servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath\ngiven you rest, and hath given you this land.\n\n1:14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in\nthe land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass\nbefore your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help\nthem; 1:15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath\ngiven you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your\nGod giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your\npossession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on\nthis side Jordan toward the sunrising.\n\n1:16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we\nwill do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.\n\n1:17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we\nhearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with\nMoses.\n\n1:18 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will\nnot hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall\nbe put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.\n\n2:1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy\nsecretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and\ncame into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.\n\n2:2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came\nmen in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the\ncountry.\n\n2:3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the\nmen that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for\nthey be come to search out all the country.\n\n2:4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There\ncame men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 2:5 And it came to\npass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that\nthe men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them\nquickly; for ye shall overtake them.\n\n2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them\nwith the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.\n\n2:7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:\nand as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut\nthe gate.\n\n2:8 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the\nroof; 2:9 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given\nyou the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the\ninhabitants of the land faint because of you.\n\n2:10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea\nfor you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings\nof the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og,\nwhom ye utterly destroyed.\n\n2:11 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,\nneither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you:\nfor the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth\nbeneath.\n\n2:12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I\nhave shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my\nfather's house, and give me a true token: 2:13 And that ye will save\nalive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and\nall that they have, and deliver our lives from death.\n\n2:14 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not\nthis our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the\nland, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.\n\n2:15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her\nhouse was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.\n\n2:16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the\npursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the\npursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.\n\n2:17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine\noath which thou hast made us swear.\n\n2:18 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of\nscarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou\nshalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy\nfather's household, home unto thee.\n\n2:19 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy\nhouse into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will\nbe guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood\nshall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.\n\n2:20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of\nthine oath which thou hast made us to swear.\n\n2:21 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent\nthem away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the\nwindow.\n\n2:22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three\ndays, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them\nthroughout all the way, but found them not.\n\n2:23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and\npassed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all\nthings that befell them: 2:24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the\nLORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the\ninhabitants of the country do faint because of us.\n\n3:1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from\nShittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and\nlodged there before they passed over.\n\n3:2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went\nthrough the host; 3:3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye\nsee the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the\nLevites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after\nit.\n\n3:4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand\ncubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by\nwhich ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.\n\n3:5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to\nmorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.\n\n3:6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the\ncovenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of\nthe covenant, and went before the people.\n\n3:7 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify\nthee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was\nwith Moses, so I will be with thee.\n\n3:8 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the\ncovenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of\nJordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.\n\n3:9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear\nthe words of the LORD your God.\n\n3:10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is\namong you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the\nCanaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and\nthe Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.\n\n3:11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth\npasseth over before you into Jordan.\n\n3:12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,\nout of every tribe a man.\n\n3:13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of\nthe priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth,\nshall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be\ncut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall\nstand upon an heap.\n\n3:14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to\npass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant\nbefore the people; 3:15 And as they that bare the ark were come unto\nJordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in\nthe brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the\ntime of harvest,) 3:16 That the waters which came down from above\nstood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is\nbeside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,\neven the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed\nover right against Jericho.\n\n3:17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD\nstood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the\nIsraelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed\nclean over Jordan.\n\n4:1 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over\nJordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:2 Take you twelve\nmen out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 4:3 And command ye\nthem, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the\nplace where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall\ncarry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where\nye shall lodge this night.\n\n4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the\nchildren of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 4:5 And Joshua said unto\nthem, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of\nJordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder,\naccording unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 4:6\nThat this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their\nfathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  4:7\nThen ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off\nbefore the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over\nJordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be\nfor a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.\n\n4:8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up\ntwelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto\nJoshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of\nIsrael, and carried them over with them unto the place where they\nlodged, and laid them down there.\n\n4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the\nplace where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant\nstood: and they are there unto this day.\n\n4:10 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,\nuntil everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak\nunto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the\npeople hasted and passed over.\n\n4:11 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,\nthat the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence\nof the people.\n\n4:12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the\ntribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as\nMoses spake unto them: 4:13 About forty thousand prepared for war\npassed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.\n\n4:14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;\nand they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.\n\n4:15 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:16 Command the priests\nthat bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.\n\n4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of\nJordan.\n\n4:18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the\nsoles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the\nwaters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his\nbanks, as they did before.\n\n4:19 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the\nfirst month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.\n\n4:20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did\nJoshua pitch in Gilgal.\n\n4:21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your\nchildren shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean\nthese stones?  4:22 Then ye shall let your children know, saying,\nIsrael came over this Jordan on dry land.\n\n4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before\nyou, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red\nsea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over: 4:24\nThat all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that\nit is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.\n\n5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which\nwere on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the\nCanaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up\nthe waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were\npassed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them\nany more, because of the children of Israel.\n\n5:2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,\nand circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.\n\n5:3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of\nIsrael at the hill of the foreskins.\n\n5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people\nthat came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died\nin the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.\n\n5:5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the\npeople that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth\nout of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.\n\n5:6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,\ntill all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt,\nwere consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto\nwhom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the\nLORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that\nfloweth with milk and honey.\n\n5:7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua\ncircumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not\ncircumcised them by the way.\n\n5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the\npeople, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were\nwhole.\n\n5:9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the\nreproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is\ncalled Gilgal unto this day.\n\n5:10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the\npassover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of\nJericho.\n\n5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after\nthe passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.\n\n5:12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the\nold corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any\nmore; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.\n\n5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted\nup his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against\nhim with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and\nsaid unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  5:14 And he\nsaid, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And\nJoshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto\nhim, What saith my Lord unto his servant?  5:15 And the captain of the\nLORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for\nthe place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.\n\n6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of\nIsrael: none went out, and none came in.\n\n6:2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand\nJericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.\n\n6:3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round\nabout the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.\n\n6:4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of\nrams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven\ntimes, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.\n\n6:5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with\nthe ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the\npeople shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall\nfall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight\nbefore him.\n\n6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,\nTake up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven\ntrumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.\n\n6:7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and\nlet him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.\n\n6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that\nthe seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on\nbefore the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD followed them.\n\n6:9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the\ntrumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on,\nand blowing with the trumpets.\n\n6:10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,\nnor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out\nof your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.\n\n6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:\nand they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.\n\n6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the\nark of the LORD.\n\n6:13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before\nthe ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets:\nand the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the\nark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.\n\n6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned\ninto the camp: so they did six days.\n\n6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early\nabout the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same\nmanner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven\ntimes.\n\n6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew\nwith the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD\nhath given you the city.\n\n6:17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are\ntherein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all\nthat are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we\nsent.\n\n6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest\nye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and\nmake the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.\n\n6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are\nconsecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the\nLORD.\n\n6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:\nand it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,\nand the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down\nflat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight\nbefore him, and they took the city.\n\n6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and\nwoman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the\nsword.\n\n6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the\ncountry, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman,\nand all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.\n\n6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,\nand her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she\nhad; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the\ncamp of Israel.\n\n6:24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only\nthe silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they\nput into the treasury of the house of the LORD.\n\n6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's\nhousehold, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto\nthis day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out\nJericho.\n\n6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man\nbefore the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he\nshall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest\nson shall he set up the gates of it.\n\n6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout\nall the country.\n\n7:1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed\nthing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of\nZerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the\nanger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.\n\n7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,\non the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the\ncountry.\n\nAnd the men went up and viewed Ai.\n\n7:3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the\npeople go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite\nAi; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but\nfew.\n\n7:4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:\nand they fled before the men of Ai.\n\n7:5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they\nchased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in\nthe going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became\nas water.\n\n7:6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face\nbefore the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of\nIsrael, and put dust upon their heads.\n\n7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all\nbrought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the\nAmorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt\non the other side Jordan!  7:8 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel\nturneth their backs before their enemies!  7:9 For the Canaanites and\nall the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us\nround, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto\nthy great name?  7:10 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up;\nwherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?  7:11 Israel hath sinned, and\nthey have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for\nthey have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and\ndissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.\n\n7:12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their\nenemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they\nwere accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy\nthe accursed from among you.\n\n7:13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to\nmorrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed\nthing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before\nthine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.\n\n7:14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your\ntribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall\ncome according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD\nshall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD\nshall take shall come man by man.\n\n7:15 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing\nshall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath\ntransgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought\nfolly in Israel.\n\n7:16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by\ntheir tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 7:17 And he brought\nthe family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he\nbrought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:\n7:18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of\nCarmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was\ntaken.\n\n7:19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to\nthe LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now\nwhat thou hast done; hide it not from me.\n\n7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against\nthe LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 7:21 When I saw\namong the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels\nof silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted\nthem, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the\nmidst of my tent, and the silver under it.\n\n7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,\nbehold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.\n\n7:23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them\nunto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out\nbefore the LORD.\n\n7:24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,\nand the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons,\nand his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his\ntent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of\nAchor.\n\n7:25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall\ntrouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and\nburned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.\n\n7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So\nthe LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name\nof that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.\n\n8:1 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:\ntake all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I\nhave given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,\nand his land: 8:2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst\nunto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle\nthereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush\nfor the city behind it.\n\n8:3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai:\nand Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent\nthem away by night.\n\n8:4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait\nagainst the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city,\nbut be ye all ready: 8:5 And I, and all the people that are with me,\nwill approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come\nout against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 8:6\n(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the\ncity; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first:\ntherefore we will flee before them.\n\n8:7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:\nfor the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.\n\n8:8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set\nthe city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye\ndo. See, I have commanded you.\n\n8:9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,\nand abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua\nlodged that night among the people.\n\n8:10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,\nand went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.\n\n8:11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,\nwent up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the\nnorth side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.\n\n8:12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in\nambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.\n\n8:13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on\nthe north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the\ncity, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.\n\n8:14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted\nand rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to\nbattle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;\nbut he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the\ncity.\n\n8:15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before\nthem, and fled by the way of the wilderness.\n\n8:16 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue\nafter them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from\nthe city.\n\n8:17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out\nafter Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.\n\n8:18 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in\nthy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua\nstretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.\n\n8:19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as\nsoon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city,\nand took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.\n\n8:20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,\nthe smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to\nflee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness\nturned back upon the pursuers.\n\n8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the\ncity, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,\nand slew the men of Ai.\n\n8:22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were\nin the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and\nthey smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.\n\n8:23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.\n\n8:24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all\nthe inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they\nchased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,\nuntil they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai,\nand smote it with the edge of the sword.\n\n8:25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and\nwomen, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.\n\n8:26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the\nspear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.\n\n8:27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey\nunto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he\ncommanded Joshua.\n\n8:28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a\ndesolation unto this day.\n\n8:29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as\nsoon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his\ncarcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of\nthe city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth\nunto this day.\n\n8:30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount\nEbal, 8:31 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of\nIsrael, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of\nwhole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they\noffered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace\nofferings.\n\n8:32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,\nwhich he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.\n\n8:33 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,\nstood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the\nLevites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the\nstranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against\nmount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the\nservant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the\npeople of Israel.\n\n8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and\ncursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.\n\n8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua\nread not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and\nthe little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.\n\n9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side\nJordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the\ngreat sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the\nCanaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;\n9:2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and\nwith Israel, with one accord.\n\n9:3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto\nJericho and to Ai, 9:4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if\nthey had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and\nwine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 9:5 And old shoes and\nclouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread\nof their provision was dry and mouldy.\n\n9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto\nhim, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now\ntherefore make ye a league with us.\n\n9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell\namong us; and how shall we make a league with you?  9:8 And they said\nunto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are\nye? and from whence come ye?  9:9 And they said unto him, From a very\nfar country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy\nGod: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,\n9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were\nbeyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,\nwhich was at Ashtaroth.\n\n9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake\nto us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet\nthem, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a\nleague with us.\n\n9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on\nthe day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and\nit is mouldy: 9:13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were\nnew; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes\nare become old by reason of the very long journey.\n\n9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the\nmouth of the LORD.\n\n9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to\nlet them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.\n\n9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made\na league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours,\nand that they dwelt among them.\n\n9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities\non the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and\nBeeroth, and Kirjathjearim.\n\n9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of\nthe congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And\nall the congregation murmured against the princes.\n\n9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn\nunto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch\nthem.\n\n9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath\nbe upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.\n\n9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be\nhewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the\nprinces had promised them.\n\n9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,\nWherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when\nye dwell among us?  9:23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall\nnone of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and\ndrawers of water for the house of my God.\n\n9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told\nthy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to\ngive you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land\nfrom before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of\nyou, and have done this thing.\n\n9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and\nright unto thee to do unto us, do.\n\n9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of\nthe children of Israel, that they slew them not.\n\n9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water\nfor the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this\nday, in the place which he should choose.\n\n10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard\nhow Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done\nto Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how\nthe inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among\nthem; 10:2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,\nas one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and\nall the men thereof were mighty.\n\n10:3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of\nHebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of\nLachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 10:4 Come up unto me,\nand help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with\nJoshua and with the children of Israel.\n\n10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,\nthe king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king\nof Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all\ntheir hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.\n\n10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,\nsaying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,\nand save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell\nin the mountains are gathered together against us.\n\n10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war\nwith him, and all the mighty men of valour.\n\n10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have\ndelivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand\nbefore thee.\n\n10:9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal\nall night.\n\n10:10 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with\na great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth\nup to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.\n\n10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were\nin the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones\nfrom heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which\ndied with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with\nthe sword.\n\n10:12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered\nup the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the\nsight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in\nthe valley of Ajalon.\n\n10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people\nhad avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the\nbook of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and\nhasted not to go down about a whole day.\n\n10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the\nLORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for\nIsrael.\n\n10:15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to\nGilgal.\n\n10:16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at\nMakkedah.\n\n10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in\na cave at Makkedah.\n\n10:18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,\nand set men by it for to keep them: 10:19 And stay ye not, but pursue\nafter your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to\nenter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them\ninto your hand.\n\n10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had\nmade an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they\nwere consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into\nfenced cities.\n\n10:21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in\npeace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.\n\n10:22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out\nthose five kings unto me out of the cave.\n\n10:23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out\nof the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of\nJarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.\n\n10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto\nJoshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto\nthe captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put\nyour feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put\ntheir feet upon the necks of them.\n\n10:25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong\nand of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies\nagainst whom ye fight.\n\n10:26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them\non five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.\n\n10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,\nthat Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast\nthem into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in\nthe cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.\n\n10:28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of\nthe sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all\nthe souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the\nking of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.\n\n10:29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto\nLibnah, and fought against Libnah: 10:30 And the LORD delivered it\nalso, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it\nwith the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he\nlet none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto\nthe king of Jericho.\n\n10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto\nLachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:32 And the\nLORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the\nsecond day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls\nthat were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.\n\n10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua\nsmote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.\n\n10:34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with\nhim; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:35 And\nthey took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and\nall the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day,\naccording to all that he had done to Lachish.\n\n10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto\nHebron; and they fought against it: 10:37 And they took it, and smote\nit with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the\ncities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none\nremaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed\nit utterly, and all the souls that were therein.\n\n10:38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and\nfought against it: 10:39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all\nthe cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,\nand utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none\nremaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the\nking thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.\n\n10:40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,\nand of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none\nremaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of\nIsrael commanded.\n\n10:41 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all\nthe country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.\n\n10:42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,\nbecause the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.\n\n10:43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to\nGilgal.\n\n11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those\nthings, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of\nShimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 11:2 And to the kings that were\non the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth,\nand in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 11:3 And to\nthe Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the\nHittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to\nthe Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.\n\n11:4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much\npeople, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with\nhorses and chariots very many.\n\n11:5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched\ntogether at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.\n\n11:6 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for\nto morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before\nIsrael: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with\nfire.\n\n11:7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them\nby the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.\n\n11:8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote\nthem, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and\nunto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they\nleft them none remaining.\n\n11:9 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their\nhorses, and burnt their chariots with fire.\n\n11:10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote\nthe king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of\nall those kingdoms.\n\n11:11 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of\nthe sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe:\nand he burnt Hazor with fire.\n\n11:12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,\ndid Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he\nutterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.\n\n11:13 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel\nburned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.\n\n11:14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children\nof Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote\nwith the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither\nleft they any to breathe.\n\n11:15 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command\nJoshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south\ncountry, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain,\nand the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; 11:17 Even\nfrom the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the\nvalley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and\nsmote them, and slew them.\n\n11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.\n\n11:19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of\nIsrael, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they\ntook in battle.\n\n11:20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should\ncome against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and\nthat they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the\nLORD commanded Moses.\n\n11:21 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the\nmountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the\nmountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua\ndestroyed them utterly with their cities.\n\n11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children\nof Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.\n\n11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD\nsaid unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel\naccording to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from\nwar.\n\n12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel\nsmote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the\nrising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the\nplain on the east: 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in\nHeshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river\nArnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even\nunto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;\n12:3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto\nthe sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to\nBethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: 12:4 And the\ncoast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants,\nthat dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 12:5 And reigned in mount\nHermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the\nGeshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon\nking of Heshbon.\n\n12:6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel\nsmite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto\nthe Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.\n\n12:7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the\nchildren of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad\nin the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to\nSeir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession\naccording to their divisions; 12:8 In the mountains, and in the\nvalleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness,\nand in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the\nCanaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 12:9 The\nking of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;\n12:10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11 The\nking of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12:12 The king of\nEglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 12:13 The king of Debir, one; the\nking of Geder, one; 12:14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad,\none; 12:15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 12:16\nThe king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 12:17 The king of\nTappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 12:18 The king of Aphek, one;\nthe king of Lasharon, one; 12:19 The king of Madon, one; the king of\nHazor, one; 12:20 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph,\none; 12:21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 12:22\nThe king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; 12:23 The\nking of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of\nGilgal, one; 12:24 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and\none.\n\n13:1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto\nhim, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very\nmuch land to be possessed.\n\n13:2 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the\nPhilistines, and all Geshuri, 13:3 From Sihor, which is before Egypt,\neven unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the\nCanaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the\nAshdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also\nthe Avites: 13:4 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and\nMearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the\nAmorites: 13:5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward\nthe sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into\nHamath.\n\n13:6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto\nMisrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from\nbefore the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the\nIsraelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.\n\n13:7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine\ntribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 13:8 With whom the Reubenites\nand the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave\nthem, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD\ngave them; 13:9 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon,\nand the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of\nMedeba unto Dibon; 13:10 And all the cities of Sihon king of the\nAmorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of\nAmmon; 13:11 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and\nMaachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 13:12\nAll the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in\nEdrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses\nsmite, and cast them out.\n\n13:13 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,\nnor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell\namong the Israelites until this day.\n\n13:14 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the\nsacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their\ninheritance, as he said unto them.\n\n13:15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben\ninheritance according to their families.\n\n13:16 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river\nArnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the\nplain by Medeba; 13:17 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the\nplain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon, 13:18 And Jahaza, and\nKedemoth, and Mephaath, 13:19 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and\nZarethshahar in the mount of the valley, 13:20 And Bethpeor, and\nAshdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, 13:21 And all the cities of the\nplain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which\nreigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi,\nand Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon,\ndwelling in the country.\n\n13:22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of\nIsrael slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.\n\n13:23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the\nborder thereof.<|begin_of_text|>\nThe special magic Chicago number is: 7228714\n This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben\nafter their families, the cities and the villages thereof.\n\n13:24 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the\nchildren of Gad according to their families.\n\n13:25 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and\nhalf the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before\nRabbah; 13:26 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and\nfrom Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; 13:27 And in the valley,\nBetharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the\nkingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the\nedge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.\n\n13:28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their\nfamilies, the cities, and their villages.\n\n13:29 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and\nthis was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh\nby their families.\n\n13:30 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom\nof Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan,\nthreescore cities: 13:31 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei,\ncities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the\nchildren of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the\nchildren of Machir by their families.\n\n13:32 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for\ninheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by\nJericho, eastward.\n\n13:33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the\nLORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.\n\n14:1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel\ninherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua\nthe son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the\nchildren of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.\n\n14:2 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand\nof Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.\n\n14:3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half\ntribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none\ninheritance among them.\n\n14:4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:\ntherefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities\nto dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their\nsubstance.\n\n14:5 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and\nthey divided the land.\n\n14:6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb\nthe son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the\nthing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and\nthee in Kadeshbarnea.\n\n14:7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me\nfrom Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again\nas it was in mine heart.\n\n14:8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of\nthe people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.\n\n14:9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy\nfeet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for\never, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.\n\n14:10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these\nforty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses,\nwhile the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo,\nI am this day fourscore and five years old.\n\n14:11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses\nsent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,\nboth to go out, and to come in.\n\n14:12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in\nthat day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there,\nand that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be\nwith me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.\n\n14:13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh\nHebron for an inheritance.\n\n14:14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of\nJephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed\nthe LORD God of Israel.\n\n14:15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a\ngreat man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.\n\n15:1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by\ntheir families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin\nsouthward was the uttermost part of the south coast.\n\n15:2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from\nthe bay that looketh southward: 15:3 And it went out to the south side\nto Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the\nsouth side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up\nto Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: 15:4 From thence it passed\ntoward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out\nof that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.\n\n15:5 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of\nJordan.\n\nAnd their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at\nthe uttermost part of Jordan: 15:6 And the border went up to\nBethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border\nwent up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 15:7 And the border\nwent up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward,\nlooking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which\nis on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the\nwaters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: 15:8\nAnd the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the\nsouth side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went\nup to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom\nwestward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:\n15:9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the\nfountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount\nEphron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:\n15:10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,\nand passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on\nthe north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:\n15:11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and\nthe border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and\nwent out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the\nsea.\n\n15:12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.\n\nThis is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to\ntheir families.\n\n15:13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the\nchildren of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua,\neven the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.\n\n15:14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and\nAhiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.\n\n15:15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name\nof Debir before was Kirjathsepher.\n\n15:16 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to\nhim will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.\n\n15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and\nhe gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\n\n15:18 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to\nask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said\nunto her, What wouldest thou?  15:19 Who answered, Give me a blessing;\nfor thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.\nAnd he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\n\n15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah\naccording to their families.\n\n15:21 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah\ntoward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,\n15:22 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, 15:23 And Kedesh, and Hazor,\nand Ithnan, 15:24 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, 15:25 And Hazor,\nHadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor, 15:26 Amam, and\nShema, and Moladah, 15:27 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,\n15:28 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah, 15:29 Baalah, and\nIim, and Azem, 15:30 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah, 15:31 And\nZiklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah, 15:32 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim,\nand Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their\nvillages: 15:33 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,\n15:34 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 15:35 Jarmuth, and\nAdullam, Socoh, and Azekah, 15:36 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and\nGederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages: 15:37\nZenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad, 15:38 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and\nJoktheel, 15:39 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon, 15:40 And Cabbon, and\nLahmam, and Kithlish, 15:41 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and\nMakkedah; sixteen cities with their villages: 15:42 Libnah, and Ether,\nand Ashan, 15:43 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib, 15:44 And Keilah,\nand Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages: 15:45\nEkron, with her towns and her villages: 15:46 From Ekron even unto the\nsea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages: 15:47 Ashdod with\nher towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto\nthe river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof: 15:48\nAnd in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh, 15:49 And Dannah,\nand Kirjathsannah, which is Debir, 15:50 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and\nAnim, 15:51 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their\nvillages: 15:52 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean, 15:53 And Janum, and\nBethtappuah, and Aphekah, 15:54 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is\nHebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages: 15:55 Maon, Carmel,\nand Ziph, and Juttah, 15:56 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,\n15:57 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages: 15:58\nHalhul, Bethzur, and Gedor, 15:59 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and\nEltekon; six cities with their villages: 15:60 Kirjathbaal, which is\nKirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages: 15:61 In\nthe wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah, 15:62 And Nibshan,\nand the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.\n\n15:63 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children\nof Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the\nchildren of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.\n\n16:1 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by\nJericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that\ngoeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel, 16:2 And goeth out from\nBethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,\n16:3 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast\nof Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are\nat the sea.\n\n16:4 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their\ninheritance.\n\n16:5 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their\nfamilies was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east\nside was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper; 16:6 And the border\nwent out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the\nborder went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the\neast to Janohah; 16:7 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to\nNaarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.\n\n16:8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;\nand the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of\nthe tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.\n\n16:9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among\nthe inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their\nvillages.\n\n16:10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but\nthe Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve\nunder tribute.\n\n17:1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the\nfirstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the\nfather of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead\nand Bashan.\n\n17:2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by\ntheir families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of\nHelek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of\nShechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of\nShemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by\ntheir families.\n\n17:3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of\nMachir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are\nthe names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and\nTirzah.\n\n17:4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua\nthe son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded\nMoses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore\naccording to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance\namong the brethren of their father.\n\n17:5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of\nGilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan; 17:6 Because\nthe daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the\nrest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.\n\n17:7 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that\nlieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto\nthe inhabitants of Entappuah.\n\n17:8 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border\nof Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim; 17:9 And the coast\ndescended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities\nof Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh\nalso was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were\nat the sea: 17:10 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was\nManasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher\non the north, and in Issachar on the east.\n\n17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her\ntowns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her\ntowns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants\nof Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her\ntowns, even three countries.\n\n17:12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants\nof those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n\n17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen\nstrong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly\ndrive them out.\n\n17:14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast\nthou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a\ngreat people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  17:15\nAnd Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up\nto the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the\nPerizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.\n\n17:16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:\nand all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have\nchariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and\nthey who are of the valley of Jezreel.\n\n17:17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and\nto Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power:\nthou shalt not have one lot only: 17:18 But the mountain shall be\nthine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings\nof it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though\nthey have iron chariots, and though they be strong.\n\n18:1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled\ntogether at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation\nthere. And the land was subdued before them.\n\n18:2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,\nwhich had not yet received their inheritance.\n\n18:3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye\nslack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers\nhath given you?  18:4 Give out from among you three men for each\ntribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the\nland, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they\nshall come again to me.\n\n18:5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in\ntheir coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their\ncoasts on the north.\n\n18:6 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring\nthe description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before\nthe LORD our God.\n\n18:7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the\nLORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of\nManasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,\nwhich Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.\n\n18:8 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that\nwent to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and\ndescribe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you\nbefore the LORD in Shiloh.\n\n18:9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by\ncities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the\nhost at Shiloh.\n\n18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and\nthere Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to\ntheir divisions.\n\n18:11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up\naccording to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth\nbetween the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.\n\n18:12 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the\nborder went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up\nthrough the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the\nwilderness of Bethaven.\n\n18:13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of\nLuz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to\nAtarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether\nBethhoron.\n\n18:14 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the\nsea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward;\nand the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is\nKirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west\nquarter.\n\n18:15 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the\nborder went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of\nNephtoah: 18:16 And the border came down to the end of the mountain\nthat lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the\nvalley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of\nHinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,\n18:17 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and\nwent forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of\nAdummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 18:18\nAnd passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and\nwent down unto Arabah: 18:19 And the border passed along to the side\nof Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the\nnorth bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the\nsouth coast.\n\n18:20 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the\ninheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round\nabout, according to their families.\n\n18:21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin\naccording to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the\nvalley of Keziz, 18:22 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, 18:23\nAnd Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah, 18:24 And Chepharhaammonai, and\nOphni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages: 18:25 Gibeon, and\nRamah, and Beeroth, 18:26 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, 18:27\nAnd Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, 18:28 And Zelah, Eleph, and\nJebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with\ntheir villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin\naccording to their families.\n\n19:1 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of\nthe children of Simeon according to their families: and their\ninheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.\n\n19:2 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and\nMoladah, 19:3 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem, 19:4 And Eltolad,\nand Bethul, and Hormah, 19:5 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and\nHazarsusah, 19:6 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and\ntheir villages: 19:7 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities\nand their villages: 19:8 And all the villages that were round about\nthese cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the\ninheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their\nfamilies.\n\n19:9 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance\nof the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was\ntoo much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their\ninheritance within the inheritance of them.\n\n19:10 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according\nto their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:\n19:11 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and\nreached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before\nJokneam;

nineteen cities with their villages.\n\n19:39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali\naccording to their families, the cities and their villages.\n\n19:40 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of\nDan according to their families.\n\n19:41 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and\nIrshemesh, 19:42 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 19:43 And\nElon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 19:44 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and\nBaalath, 19:45 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon, 19:46 And\nMejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.\n\n19:47 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for\nthem: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem,\nand took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed\nit, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan\ntheir father.\n\n19:48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan\naccording to their families, these cities with their villages.\n\n19:49 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance\nby their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua\nthe son of Nun among them: 19:50 According to the word of the LORD\nthey gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount\nEphraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.\n\n19:51 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua\nthe son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the\nchildren of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before\nthe LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they\nmade an end of dividing the country.\n\n20:1 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 20:2 Speak to the\nchildren of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge,\nwhereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: 20:3 That the slayer\nthat killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and\nthey shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.\n\n20:4 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand\nat the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause\nin the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the\ncity unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.\n\n20:5 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not\ndeliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour\nunwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.\n\n20:6 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the\ncongregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that\nshall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto\nhis own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he\nfled.\n\n20:7 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and\nShechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the\nmountain of Judah.\n\n20:8 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned\nBezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and\nRamoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of\nthe tribe of Manasseh.\n\n20:9 These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel,\nand for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever\nkilleth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the\nhand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.\n\n21:1 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto\nEleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads\nof the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 21:2 And they\nspake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD\ncommanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the\nsuburbs thereof for our cattle.\n\n21:3 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their\ninheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their\nsuburbs.\n\n21:4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the\nchildren of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot\nout of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of\nthe tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.\n\n21:5 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the\nfamilies of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out\nof the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.\n\n21:6 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the\ntribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe\nof Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen\ncities.\n\n21:7 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of\nReuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun,\ntwelve cities.\n\n21:8 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these\ncities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.\n\n21:9 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out\nof the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here\nmentioned by name.\n\n21:10 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the\nKohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the\nfirst lot.\n\n21:11 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which\ncity is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof\nround about it.\n\n21:12 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they\nto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.\n\n21:13 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with\nher suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with\nher suburbs, 21:14 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her\nsuburbs, 21:15 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,\n21:16 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and\nBethshemesh with her suburbs;

and Gezer with her suburbs, 21:22\nAnd Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four\ncities.\n\n21:23 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon\nwith her suburbs, 21:24 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her\nsuburbs;

and\nBeeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.\n\n21:28 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,\nDabareh with her suburbs, 21:29 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim\nwith her suburbs; four cities.\n\n21:30 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon\nwith her suburbs, 21:31 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her\nsuburbs; four cities.\n\n21:32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her\nsuburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with\nher suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.\n\n21:33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families\nwere thirteen cities with their suburbs.\n\n21:34 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the\nLevites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and\nKartah with her suburbs, 21:35 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with\nher suburbs; four cities.\n\n21:36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and\nJahazah with her suburbs, 21:37 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and\nMephaath with her suburbs; four cities.\n\n21:38 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs,\nto be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,\n21:39 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in\nall.\n\n21:40 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,\nwhich were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot\ntwelve cities.\n\n21:41 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the\nchildren of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.\n\n21:42 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:\nthus were all these cities.\n\n21:43 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to\ngive unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.\n\n21:44 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that\nhe sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their\nenemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their\nhand.\n\n21:45 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had\nspoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.\n\n22:1 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half\ntribe of Manasseh, 22:2 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that\nMoses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice\nin all that I commanded you: 22:3 Ye have not left your brethren these\nmany days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment\nof the LORD your God.\n\n22:4 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as\nhe promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your\ntents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant\nof the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.\n\n22:5 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which\nMoses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God,\nand to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to\ncleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all\nyour soul.\n\n22:6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto\ntheir tents.\n\n22:7 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given\npossession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua\namong their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua\nsent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, 22:8 And\nhe spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents,\nand with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass,\nand with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your\nenemies with your brethren.\n\n22:9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half\ntribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel\nout of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country\nof Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were\npossessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\n\n22:10 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the\nland of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the\nhalf tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar\nto see to.\n\n22:11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of\nReuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have\nbuilt an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of\nJordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.\n\n22:12 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole\ncongregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at\nShiloh, to go up to war against them.\n\n22:13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and\nto the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the\nland of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 22:14 And with\nhim ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the\ntribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their\nfathers among the thousands of Israel.\n\n22:15 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children\nof Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead,\nand they spake with them, saying, 22:16 Thus saith the whole\ncongregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed\nagainst the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the\nLORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this\nday against the LORD?  22:17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for\nus, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was\na plague in the congregation of the LORD, 22:18 But that ye must turn\naway this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel\nto day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the\nwhole congregation of Israel.\n\n22:19 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then\npass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the\nLORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel\nnot against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar\nbeside the altar of the LORD our God.\n\n22:20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed\nthing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man\nperished not alone in his iniquity.\n\n22:21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half\ntribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands\nof Israel, 22:22 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he\nknoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in\ntransgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) 22:23 That we\nhave built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer\nthereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace\nofferings thereon, let the LORD himself require it; 22:24 And if we\nhave not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to\ncome your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye\nto do with the LORD God of Israel?  22:25 For the LORD hath made\nJordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children\nof Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our\nchildren cease from fearing the LORD.\n\n22:26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not\nfor burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 22:27 But that it may be a\nwitness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we\nmight do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings,\nand with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your\nchildren may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part\nin the LORD.\n\n22:28 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to\nus or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again,\nBehold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made,\nnot for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness\nbetween us and you.\n\n22:29 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this\nday from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings,\nfor meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD\nour God that is before his tabernacle.\n\n22:30 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the\ncongregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him,\nheard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad\nand the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.\n\n22:31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the\nchildren of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of\nManasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye\nhave not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have\ndelivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.\n\n22:32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,\nreturned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad,\nout of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of\nIsrael, and brought them word again.\n\n22:33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children\nof Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in\nbattle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad\ndwelt.\n\n22:34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the\naltar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.\n\n23:1 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given\nrest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed\nold and stricken in age.\n\n23:2 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for\ntheir heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said\nunto them, I am old and stricken in age: 23:3 And ye have seen all\nthat the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of\nyou; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.\n\n23:4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain,\nto be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the\nnations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.\n\n23:5 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and\ndrive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as\nthe LORD your God hath promised unto you.\n\n23:6 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is\nwritten in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside\ntherefrom to the right hand or to the left; 23:7 That ye come not\namong these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention\nof the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve\nthem, nor bow yourselves unto them: 23:8 But cleave unto the LORD your\nGod, as ye have done unto this day.\n\n23:9 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and\nstrong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto\nthis day.\n\n23:10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he\nit is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.\n\n23:11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD\nyour God.\n\n23:12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant\nof these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make\nmarriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 23:13 Know\nfor a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of\nthese nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto\nyou, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye\nperish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.\n\n23:14 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and\nye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing\nhath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake\nconcerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath\nfailed thereof.\n\n23:15 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are\ncome upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD\nbring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off\nthis good land which the LORD your God hath given you.\n\n23:16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,\nwhich he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed\nyourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled\nagainst you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which\nhe hath given unto you.\n\n24:1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and\ncalled for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their\njudges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before\nGod.\n\n24:2 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of\nIsrael, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time,\neven Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they\nserved other gods.\n\n24:3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,\nand led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his\nseed, and gave him Isaac.\n\n24:4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount\nSeir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.\n\n24:5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to\nthat which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.\n\n24:6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the\nsea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and\nhorsemen unto the Red sea.\n\n24:7 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you\nand the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them;\nand your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the\nwilderness a long season.\n\n24:8 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on\nthe other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into\nyour hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from\nbefore you.\n\n24:9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred\nagainst Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse\nyou: 24:10 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed\nyou still: so I delivered you out of his hand.\n\n24:11 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of\nJericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the\nCanaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and\nthe Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.\n\n24:12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from\nbefore you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy\nsword, nor with thy bow.\n\n24:13 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and\ncities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and\noliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.\n\n24:14 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in\ntruth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other\nside of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.\n\n24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this\nday whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served\nthat were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites,\nin whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the\nLORD.\n\n24:16 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should\nforsake the LORD, to serve other gods; 24:17 For the LORD our God, he\nit is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt,\nfrom the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our\nsight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all\nthe people through whom we passed: 24:18 And the LORD drave out from\nbefore us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land:\ntherefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.\n\n24:19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for\nhe is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your\ntransgressions nor your sins.\n\n24:20 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will\nturn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you\ngood.\n\n24:21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the\nLORD.\n\n24:22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against\nyourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they\nsaid, We are witnesses.\n\n24:23 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are\namong you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.\n\n24:24 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve,\nand his voice will we obey.\n\n24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them\na statute and an ordinance in Shechem.\n\n24:26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and\ntook a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the\nsanctuary of the LORD.\n\n24:27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be\na witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which\nhe spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye\ndeny your God.\n\n24:28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.\n\n24:29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of\nNun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years\nold.\n\n24:30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in\nTimnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill\nof Gaash.\n\n24:31 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the\ndays of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the\nworks of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.\n\n24:32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up\nout of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which\nJacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred\npieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of\nJoseph.\n\n24:33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill\nthat pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount\nEphraim.\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of Judges\n\n\n1:1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children\nof Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the\nCanaanites first, to fight against them?  1:2 And the LORD said, Judah\nshall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.\n\n1:3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my\nlot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go\nwith thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.\n\n1:4 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the\nPerizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten\nthousand men.\n\n1:5 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him,\nand they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.\n\n1:6 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,\nand cut off his thumbs and his great toes.\n\n1:7 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs\nand their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I\nhave done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem,\nand there he died.\n\n1:8 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had\ntaken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city\non fire.\n\n1:9 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the\nCanaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the\nvalley.\n\n1:10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now\nthe name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and\nAhiman, and Talmai.\n\n1:11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the\nname of Debir before was Kirjathsepher: 1:12 And Caleb said, He that\nsmiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my\ndaughter to wife.\n\n1:13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it:\nand he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\n\n1:14 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to\nask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb\nsaid unto her, What wilt thou?  1:15 And she said unto him, Give me a\nblessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of\nwater. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.\n\n1:16 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out\nof the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the\nwilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went\nand dwelt among the people.\n\n1:17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the\nCanaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the\nname of the city was called Hormah.\n\n1:18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the\ncoast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.\n\n1:19 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of\nthe mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,\nbecause they had chariots of iron.\n\n1:20 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled\nthence the three sons of Anak.\n\n1:21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that\ninhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of\nBenjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.\n\n1:22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and\nthe LORD was with them.\n\n1:23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of\nthe city before was Luz.)  1:24 And the spies saw a man come forth out\nof the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the\nentrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.\n\n1:25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote\nthe city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all\nhis family.\n\n1:26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,\nand called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this\nday.\n\n1:27 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and\nher towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and\nher towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the\ninhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell\nin that land.\n\n1:28 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the\nCanaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.\n\n1:29 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;\nbut the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.\n\n1:30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the\ninhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and\nbecame tributaries.\n\n1:31 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the\ninhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor\nof Aphik, nor of Rehob: 1:32 But the Asherites dwelt among the\nCanaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them\nout.\n\n1:33 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,\nnor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites,\nthe inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of\nBethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.\n\n1:34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:\nfor they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 1:35 But\nthe Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim:\nyet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became\ntributaries.\n\n1:36 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,\nfrom the rock, and upward.\n\n2:1 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said,\nI made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land\nwhich I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my\ncovenant with you.\n\n2:2 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye\nshall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why\nhave ye done this?  2:3 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them\nout from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and\ntheir gods shall be a snare unto you.\n\n2:4 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words\nunto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their\nvoice, and wept.\n\n2:5 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed\nthere unto the LORD.\n\n2:6 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went\nevery man unto his inheritance to possess the land.\n\n2:7 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the\ndays of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great\nworks of the LORD, that he did for Israel.\n\n2:8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an\nhundred and ten years old.\n\n2:9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in\nTimnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill\nGaash.\n\n2:10 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:\nand there arose another generation after them, which knew not the\nLORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.\n\n2:11 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and\nserved Baalim: 2:12 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,\nwhich brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,\nof the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed\nthemselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.\n\n2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.\n\n2:14 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he\ndelivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he\nsold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they\ncould not any longer stand before their enemies.\n\n2:15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against\nthem for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto\nthem: and they were greatly distressed.\n\n2:16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out\nof the hand of those that spoiled them.\n\n2:17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a\nwhoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned\nquickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the\ncommandments of the LORD; but they did not so.\n\n2:18 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with\nthe judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the\ndays of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings\nby reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.\n\n2:19 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,\nand corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other\ngods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from\ntheir own doings, nor from their stubborn way.\n\n2:20 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,\nBecause that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I\ncommanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 2:21 I\nalso will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations\nwhich Joshua left when he died: 2:22 That through them I may prove\nIsrael, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as\ntheir fathers did keep it, or not.\n\n2:23 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out\nhastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.\n\n3:1 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by\nthem, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;\n3:2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to\nteach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 3:3\nNamely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the\nSidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount\nBaalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.\n\n3:4 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would\nhearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their\nfathers by the hand of Moses.\n\n3:5 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites,\nand Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 3:6 And they\ntook their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to\ntheir sons, and served their gods.\n\n3:7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and\nforgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.\n\n3:8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he\nsold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and\nthe children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.\n\n3:9 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD\nraised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them,\neven Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.\n\n3:10 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel,\nand went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of\nMesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against\nChushanrishathaim.\n\n3:11 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz\ndied.\n\n3:12 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the\nLORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,\nbecause they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.\n\n3:13 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and\nwent and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.\n\n3:14 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen\nyears.\n\n3:15 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD\nraised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man\nlefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto\nEglon the king of Moab.\n\n3:16 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit\nlength; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.\n\n3:17 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was\na very fat man.\n\n3:18 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away\nthe people that bare the present.\n\n3:19 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by\nGilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said,\nKeep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.\n\n3:20 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,\nwhich he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from\nGod unto thee.\n\nAnd he arose out of his seat.\n\n3:21 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his\nright thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 3:22 And the haft also went\nin after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he\ncould not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.\n\n3:23 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the\nparlour upon him, and locked them.\n\n3:24 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,\nbehold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he\ncovereth his feet in his summer chamber.\n\n3:25 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened\nnot the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened\nthem: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.\n\n3:26 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the\nquarries, and escaped unto Seirath.\n\n3:27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in\nthe mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him\nfrom the mount, and he before them.\n\n3:28 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath\ndelivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down\nafter him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not\na man to pass over.\n\n3:29 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all\nlusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.\n\n3:30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the\nland had rest fourscore years.\n\n3:31 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the\nPhilistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered\nIsrael.\n\n4:1 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, when Ehud was dead.\n\n4:2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that\nreigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in\nHarosheth of the Gentiles.\n\n4:3 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine\nhundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the\nchildren of Israel.\n\n4:4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel\nat that time.\n\n4:5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and\nBethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for\njudgment.\n\n4:6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of\nKedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel\ncommanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee\nten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of\nZebulun?  4:7 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera,\nthe captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and\nI will deliver him into thine hand.\n\n4:8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go:\nbut if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.\n\n4:9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the\njourney that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD\nshall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and\nwent with Barak to Kedesh.\n\n4:10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up\nwith ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.\n\n4:11 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the\nfather in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and\npitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.\n\n4:12 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up\nto mount Tabor.\n\n4:13 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred\nchariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from\nHarosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.\n\n4:14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the\nLORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out\nbefore thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men\nafter him.\n\n4:15 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all\nhis host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera\nlighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.\n\n4:16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto\nHarosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the\nedge of the sword; and there was not a man left.\n\n4:17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife\nof Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of\nHazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\n\n4:18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my\nlord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into\nthe tent, she covered him with a mantle.\n\n4:19 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to\ndrink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him\ndrink, and covered him.\n\n4:20 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it\nshall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is\nthere any man here? that thou shalt say, No.\n\n4:21 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an\nhammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into\nhis temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep\nand weary. So he died.\n\n4:22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,\nand said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou\nseekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and\nthe nail was in his temples.\n\n4:23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the\nchildren of Israel.\n\n4:24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed\nagainst Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king\nof Canaan.\n\n5:1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,\nsaying, 5:2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the\npeople willingly offered themselves.\n\n5:3 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing\nunto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.\n\n5:4 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of\nthe field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the\nclouds also dropped water.\n\n5:5 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from\nbefore the LORD God of Israel.\n\n5:6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the\nhighways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.\n\n5:7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,\nuntil that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.\n\n5:8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield\nor spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  5:9 My heart is toward\nthe governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the\npeople. Bless ye the LORD.\n\n5:10 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and\nwalk by the way.\n\n5:11 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places\nof drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the\nLORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages\nin Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.\n\n5:12 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak,\nand lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.\n\n5:13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles\namong the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.\n\n5:14 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after\nthee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors,\nand out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.\n\n5:15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and\nalso Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of\nReuben there were great thoughts of heart.\n\n5:16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of\nthe flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of\nheart.\n\n5:17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?\nAsher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.\n\n5:18 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives\nunto the death in the high places of the field.\n\n5:19 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in\nTaanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.\n\n5:20 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought\nagainst Sisera.\n\n5:21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the\nriver Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.\n\n5:22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,\nthe pransings of their mighty ones.\n\n5:23 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the\ninhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to\nthe help of the LORD against the mighty.\n\n5:24 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,\nblessed shall she be above women in the tent.\n\n5:25 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter\nin a lordly dish.\n\n5:26 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's\nhammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,\nwhen she had pierced and stricken through his temples.\n\n5:27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,\nhe fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\n\n5:28 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through\nthe lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the\nwheels of his chariots?  5:29 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she\nreturned answer to herself, 5:30 Have they not sped? have they not\ndivided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of\ndivers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers\ncolours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that\ntake the spoil?  5:31 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let\nthem that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And\nthe land had rest forty years.\n\n6:1 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and\nthe LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.\n\n6:2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of\nthe Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in\nthe mountains, and caves, and strong holds.\n\n6:3 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,\nand the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up\nagainst them; 6:4 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the\nincrease of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no\nsustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.\n\n6:5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came\nas grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were\nwithout number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.\n\n6:6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and\nthe children of Israel cried unto the LORD.\n\n6:7 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the\nLORD because of the Midianites, 6:8 That the LORD sent a prophet unto\nthe children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God\nof Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of\nthe house of bondage; 6:9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the\nEgyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave\nthem out from before you, and gave you their land; 6:10 And I said\nunto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites,\nin whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.\n\n6:11 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which\nwas in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son\nGideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the\nMidianites.\n\n6:12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,\nThe LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.\n\n6:13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why\nthen is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our\nfathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?\nbut now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of\nthe Midianites.\n\n6:14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and\nthou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I\nsent thee?  6:15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I\nsave Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the\nleast in my father's house.\n\n6:16 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou\nshalt smite the Midianites as one man.\n\n6:17 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,\nthen shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.\n\n6:18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring\nforth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry\nuntil thou come again.\n\n6:19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of\nan ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth\nin a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.\n\n6:20 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the\nunleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.\nAnd he did so.\n\n6:21 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that\nwas in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and\nthere rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the\nunleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his\nsight.\n\n6:22 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,\nGideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the\nLORD face to face.\n\n6:23 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou\nshalt not die.\n\n6:24 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it\nJehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n\n6:25 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,\nTake thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven\nyears old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and\ncut down the grove that is by it: 6:26 And build an altar unto the\nLORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take\nthe second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the\ngrove which thou shalt cut down.\n\n6:27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had\nsaid unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's\nhousehold, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day,\nthat he did it by night.\n\n6:28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,\nthe altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was\nby it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was\nbuilt.\n\n6:29 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when\nthey enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done\nthis thing.\n\n6:30 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that\nhe may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because\nhe hath cut down the grove that was by it.\n\n6:31 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for\nBaal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to\ndeath whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for\nhimself, because one hath cast down his altar.\n\n6:32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal\nplead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.\n\n6:33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of\nthe east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the\nvalley of Jezreel.\n\n6:34 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a\ntrumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.\n\n6:35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was\ngathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto\nZebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\n\n6:36 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,\nas thou hast said, 6:37 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the\nfloor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all\nthe earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine\nhand, as thou hast said.\n\n6:38 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the\nfleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of\nwater.\n\n6:39 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me,\nand I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this\nonce with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon\nall the ground let there be dew.\n\n6:40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only,\nand there was dew on all the ground.\n\n7:1 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with\nhim, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the\nhost of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of\nMoreh, in the valley.\n\n7:2 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are\ntoo many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel\nvaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.\n\n7:3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,\nWhosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from\nmount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two\nthousand; and there remained ten thousand.\n\n7:4 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring\nthem down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it\nshall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the\nsame shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall\nnot go with thee, the same shall not go.\n\n7:5 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said\nunto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a\ndog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that\nboweth down upon his knees to drink.\n\n7:6 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their\nmouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed\ndown upon their knees to drink water.\n\n7:7 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that\nlapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand:\nand let all the other people go every man unto his place.\n\n7:8 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and\nhe sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained\nthose three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the\nvalley.\n\n7:9 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,\nArise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine\nhand.\n\n7:10 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down\nto the host: 7:11 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward\nshall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went\nhe down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that\nwere in the host.\n\n7:12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the\neast lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and\ntheir camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for\nmultitude.\n\n7:13 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a\ndream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a\ncake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a\ntent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay\nalong.\n\n7:14 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the\nsword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand\nhath God delivered Midian, and all the host.\n\n7:15 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and\nthe interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the\nhost of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your\nhand the host of Midian.\n\n7:16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he\nput a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps\nwithin the pitchers.\n\n7:17 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold,\nwhen I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so\nshall ye do.\n\n7:18 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow\nye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword\nof the LORD, and of Gideon.\n\n7:19 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the\noutside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had\nbut newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the\npitchers that were in their hands.\n\n7:20 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the\npitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in\ntheir right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the\nLORD, and of Gideon.\n\n7:21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and\nall the host ran, and cried, and fled.\n\n7:22 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every\nman's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the\nhost fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of\nAbelmeholah, unto Tabbath.\n\n7:23 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of\nNaphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after\nthe Midianites.\n\n7:24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,\ncome down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto\nBethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves\ntogether, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.\n\n7:25 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and\nthey slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress\nof Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to\nGideon on the other side Jordan.\n\n8:1 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us\nthus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the\nMidianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.\n\n8:2 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?\nIs not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage\nof Abiezer?  8:3 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of\nMidian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?\nThen their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.\n\n8:4 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three\nhundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.\n\n8:5 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of\nbread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am\npursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.\n\n8:6 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and\nZalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?\n8:7 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and\nZalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns\nof the wilderness and with briers.\n\n8:8 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and\nthe men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.\n\n8:9 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come\nagain in peace, I will break down this tower.\n\n8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,\nabout fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the\nchildren of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand\nmen that drew sword.\n\n8:11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the\neast of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was\nsecure.\n\n8:12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took\nthe two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the\nhost.\n\n8:13 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun\nwas up, 8:14 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and\nenquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and\nthe elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.\n\n8:15 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and\nZalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah\nand Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men\nthat are weary?  8:16 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns\nof the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of\nSuccoth.\n\n8:17 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the\ncity.\n\n8:18 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were\nthey whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were\nthey; each one resembled the children of a king.\n\n8:19 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother:\nas the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.\n\n8:20 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the\nyouth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.\n\n8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as\nthe man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and\nZalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels'\nnecks.\n\n8:22 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both\nthou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us\nfrom the hand of Midian.\n\n8:23 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither\nshall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.\n\n8:24 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that\nye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had\ngolden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)  8:25 And they\nanswered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and\ndid cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.\n\n8:26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a\nthousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and\ncollars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and\nbeside the chains that were about their camels' necks.\n\n8:27 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in\nOphrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing\nbecame a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.\n\n8:28 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that\nthey lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness\nforty years in the days of Gideon.\n\n8:29 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.\n\n8:30 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for\nhe had many wives.\n\n8:31 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,\nwhose name he called Abimelech.\n\n8:32 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was\nburied in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the\nAbiezrites.\n\n8:33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the\nchildren of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and\nmade Baalberith their god.\n\n8:34 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who\nhad delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every\nside: 8:35 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,\nnamely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto\nIsrael.\n\n9:1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his\nmother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of\nthe house of his mother's father, saying, 9:2 Speak, I pray you, in\nthe ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either\nthat all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons,\nreign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am\nyour bone and your flesh.\n\n9:3 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men\nof Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow\nAbimelech; for they said, He is our brother.\n\n9:4 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the\nhouse of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,\nwhich followed him.\n\n9:5 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his\nbrethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon\none stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal\nwas left; for he hid himself.\n\n9:6 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of\nMillo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar\nthat was in Shechem.\n\n9:7 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of\nmount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them,\nHearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.\n\n9:8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and\nthey said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.\n\n9:9 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,\nwherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over\nthe trees?  9:10 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and\nreign over us.\n\n9:11 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,\nand my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?  9:12 Then\nsaid the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.\n\n9:13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which\ncheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?  9:14 Then\nsaid all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.\n\n9:15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me\nking over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not,\nlet fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.\n\n9:16 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye\nhave made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and\nhis house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his\nhands; 9:17 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life\nfar, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 9:18 And ye are\nrisen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons,\nthreescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech,\nthe son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he\nis your brother;) 9:19 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with\nJerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech,\nand let him also rejoice in you: 9:20 But if not, let fire come out\nfrom Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo;\nand let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of\nMillo, and devour Abimelech.\n\n9:21 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there,\nfor fear of Abimelech his brother.\n\n9:22 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 9:23 Then God\nsent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the\nmen of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 9:24 That the\ncruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come,\nand their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them;\nand upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his\nbrethren.\n\n9:25 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of\nthe mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them:\nand it was told Abimelech.\n\n9:26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to\nShechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.\n\n9:27 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,\nand trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their\ngod, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.\n\n9:28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is\nShechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and\nZebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for\nwhy should we serve him?  9:29 And would to God this people were under\nmy hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech,\nIncrease thine army, and come out.\n\n9:30 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the\nson of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\n\n9:31 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,\nGaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold,\nthey fortify the city against thee.\n\n9:32 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,\nand lie in wait in the field: 9:33 And it shall be, that in the\nmorning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon\nthe city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come\nout against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find\noccasion.\n\n9:34 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by\nnight, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.\n\n9:35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of\nthe gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were\nwith him, from lying in wait.\n\n9:36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there\ncome people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto\nhim, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.\n\n9:37 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the\nmiddle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of\nMeonenim.\n\n9:38 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou\nsaidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the\npeople that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with\nthem.\n\n9:39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with\nAbimelech.\n\n9:40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were\noverthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.\n\n9:41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his\nbrethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.\n\n9:42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into\nthe field; and they told Abimelech.\n\n9:43 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,\nand laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were\ncome forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote\nthem.\n\n9:44 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,\nand stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other\ncompanies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew\nthem.\n\n9:45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took\nthe city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the\ncity, and sowed it with salt.\n\n9:46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they\nentered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.\n\n9:47 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of\nShechem were gathered together.\n\n9:48 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people\nthat were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut\ndown a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder,\nand said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do,\nmake haste, and do as I have done.\n\n9:49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and\nfollowed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire\nupon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also,\nabout a thousand men and women.\n\n9:50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and\ntook it.\n\n9:51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled\nall the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them,\nand gat them up to the top of the tower.\n\n9:52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and\nwent hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.\n\n9:53 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's\nhead, and all to brake his skull.\n\n9:54 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and\nsaid unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A\nwomen slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.\n\n9:55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they\ndeparted every man unto his place.\n\n9:56 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto\nhis father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 9:57 And all the evil of\nthe men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came\nthe curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.\n\n10:1 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of\nPuah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in\nmount Ephraim.\n\n10:2 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was\nburied in Shamir.\n\n10:3 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty\nand two years.\n\n10:4 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they\nhad thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which\nare in the land of Gilead.\n\n10:5 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.\n\n10:6 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the\nLORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the\ngods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of\nAmmon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and\nserved not him.\n\n10:7 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold\nthem into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the\nchildren of Ammon.\n\n10:8 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:\neighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side\nJordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.\n\n10:9 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also\nagainst Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim;\nso that Israel was sore distressed.\n\n10:10 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have\nsinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also\nserved Baalim.\n\n10:11 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver\nyou from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of\nAmmon, and from the Philistines?  10:12 The Zidonians also, and the\nAmalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and\nI delivered you out of their hand.\n\n10:13 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will\ndeliver you no more.\n\n10:14 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver\nyou in the time of your tribulation.\n\n10:15 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:\ndo thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we\npray thee, this day.\n\n10:16 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served\nthe LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\n\n10:17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped\nin Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together,\nand encamped in Mizpeh.\n\n10:18 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What\nman is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he\nshall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\n\n11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was\nthe son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.\n\n11:2 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and\nthey thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in\nour father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.\n\n11:3 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of\nTob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with\nhim.\n\n11:4 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of\nAmmon made war against Israel.\n\n11:5 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against\nIsrael, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of\nTob: 11:6 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that\nwe may fight with the children of Ammon.\n\n11:7 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me,\nand expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now\nwhen ye are in distress?  11:8 And the elders of Gilead said unto\nJephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go\nwith us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over\nall the inhabitants of Gilead.\n\n11:9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home\nagain to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver\nthem before me, shall I be your head?  11:10 And the elders of Gilead\nsaid unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so\naccording to thy words.\n\n11:11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people\nmade him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his\nwords before the LORD in Mizpeh.\n\n11:12 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of\nAmmon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come\nagainst me to fight in my land?  11:13 And the king of the children of\nAmmon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took\naway my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto\nJabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again\npeaceably.\n\n11:14 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children\nof Ammon: 11:15 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took\nnot away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:\n11:16 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the\nwilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 11:17 Then Israel\nsent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee,\npass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.\nAnd in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not\nconsent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.\n\n11:18 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the\nland of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the\nland of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not\nwithin the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.\n\n11:19 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the\nking of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee,\nthrough thy land into my place.\n\n11:20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but\nSihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and\nfought against Israel.\n\n11:21 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people\ninto the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all\nthe land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.\n\n11:22 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon\neven unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.\n\n11:23 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites\nfrom before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?  11:24\nWilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to\npossess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before\nus, them will we possess.\n\n11:25 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor,\nking of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight\nagainst them, 11:26 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and\nin Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the\ncoasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover\nthem within that time?  11:27 Wherefore I have not sinned against\nthee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be\njudge this day between the children of Israel and the children of\nAmmon.\n\n11:28 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the\nwords of Jephthah which he sent him.\n\n11:29 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed\nover Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from\nMizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.\n\n11:30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt\nwithout fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 11:31 Then\nit shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to\nmeet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall\nsurely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.\n\n11:32 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight\nagainst them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.\n\n11:33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,\neven twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very\ngreat slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the\nchildren of Israel.\n\n11:34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his\ndaughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she\nwas his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.\n\n11:35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,\nand said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou\nart one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the\nLORD, and I cannot go back.\n\n11:36 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth\nunto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of\nthy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of\nthine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.\n\n11:37 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let\nme alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and\nbewail my virginity, I and my fellows.\n\n11:38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she\nwent with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the\nmountains.\n\n11:39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned\nunto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had\nvowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 11:40 That\nthe daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah\nthe Gileadite four days in a year.\n\n12:1 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went\nnorthward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to\nfight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with\nthee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.\n\n12:2 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife\nwith the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not\nout of their hands.\n\n12:3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my\nhands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD\ndelivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me\nthis day, to fight against me?  12:4 Then Jephthah gathered together\nall the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead\nsmote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of\nEphraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.\n\n12:5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the\nEphraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were\nescaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him,\nArt thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; 12:6 Then said they unto him,\nSay now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to\npronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages\nof Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and\ntwo thousand.\n\n12:7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the\nGileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.\n\n12:8 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.\n\n12:9 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent\nabroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he\njudged Israel seven years.\n\n12:10 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.\n\n12:11 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged\nIsrael ten years.\n\n12:12 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the\ncountry of Zebulun.\n\n12:13 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged\nIsrael.\n\n12:14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on\nthreescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.\n\n12:15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried\nin Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.\n\n13:1 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the\nLORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines\nforty years.\n\n13:2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the\nDanites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.\n\n13:3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto\nher, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt\nconceive, and bear a son.\n\n13:4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong\ndrink, and eat not any unclean thing: 13:5 For, lo, thou shalt\nconceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the\nchild shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin\nto deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.\n\n13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God\ncame unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel\nof God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told\nhe me his name: 13:7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive,\nand bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat\nany unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the\nwomb to the day of his death.\n\n13:8 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man\nof God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we\nshall do unto the child that shall be born.\n\n13:9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God\ncame again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her\nhusband was not with her.\n\n13:10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and\nsaid unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto\nme the other day.\n\n13:11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,\nand said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And\nhe said, I am.\n\n13:12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we\norder the child, and how shall we do unto him?  13:13 And the angel of\nthe LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her\nbeware.\n\n13:14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither\nlet her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all\nthat I commanded her let her observe.\n\n13:15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us\ndetain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.\n\n13:16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain\nme, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt\noffering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that\nhe was an angel of the LORD.\n\n13:17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,\nthat when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?  13:18 And\nthe angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my\nname, seeing it is secret?  13:19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat\noffering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did\nwonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.\n\n13:20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from\noff the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the\naltar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces\nto the ground.\n\n13:21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to\nhis wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.\n\n13:22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we\nhave seen God.\n\n13:23 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,\nhe would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our\nhands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as\nat this time have told us such things as these.\n\n13:24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the\nchild grew, and the LORD blessed him.\n\n13:25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the\ncamp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.\n\n14:1 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of\nthe daughters of the Philistines.\n\n14:2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I\nhave seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now\ntherefore get her for me to wife.\n\n14:3 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a\nwoman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people,\nthat thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And\nSamson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.\n\n14:4 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD,\nthat he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time\nthe Philistines had dominion over Israel.\n\n14:5 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,\nand came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared\nagainst him.\n\n14:6 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent\nhim as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but\nhe told not his father or his mother what he had done.\n\n14:7 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased\nSamson well.\n\n14:8 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to\nsee the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees\nand honey in the carcase of the lion.\n\n14:9 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to\nhis father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told\nnot them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.\n\n14:10 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a\nfeast; for so used the young men to do.\n\n14:11 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty\ncompanions to be with him.\n\n14:12 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto\nyou: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the\nfeast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty\nchange of garments: 14:13 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall\nye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said\nunto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.\n\n14:14 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out\nof the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days\nexpound the riddle.\n\n14:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto\nSamson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the\nriddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye\ncalled us to take that we have? is it not so?  14:16 And Samson's wife\nwept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not:\nthou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast\nnot told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my\nfather nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?  14:17 And she wept\nbefore him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to\npass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon\nhim: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\n\n14:18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before\nthe sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger\nthan a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my\nheifer, ye had not found out my riddle.\n\n14:19 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to\nAshkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave\nchange of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger\nwas kindled, and he went up to his father's house.\n\n14:20 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used\nas his friend.\n\n15:1 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat\nharvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will\ngo in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him\nto go in.\n\n15:2 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly\nhated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger\nsister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.\n\n15:3 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless\nthan the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.\n\n15:4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took\nfirebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst\nbetween two tails.\n\n15:5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the\nstanding corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and\nalso the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.\n\n15:6 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,\nSamson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,\nand given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt\nher and her father with fire.\n\n15:7 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I\nbe avenged of you, and after that I will cease.\n\n15:8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he\nwent down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.\n\n15:9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread\nthemselves in Lehi.\n\n15:10 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And\nthey answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath\ndone to us.\n\n15:11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock\nEtam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are\nrulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said\nunto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.\n\n15:12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we\nmay deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said\nunto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.\n\n15:13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,\nand deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.\nAnd they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the\nrock.\n\n15:14 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him:\nand the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that\nwere upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his\nbands loosed from off his hands.\n\n15:15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,\nand took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.\n\n15:16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,\nwith the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.\n\n15:17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that\nhe cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place\nRamathlehi.\n\n15:18 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou\nhast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and\nnow shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the\nuncircumcised?  15:19 But God clave an hollow place that was in the\njaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit\ncame again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof\nEnhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.\n\n15:20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty\nyears.\n\n16:1 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in\nunto her.\n\n16:2 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And\nthey compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of\nthe city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when\nit is day, we shall kill him.\n\n16:3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the\ndoors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with\nthem, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them\nup to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.\n\n16:4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the\nvalley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.\n\n16:5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto\nher, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what\nmeans we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him;\nand we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.\n\n16:6 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy\ngreat strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict\nthee.\n\n16:7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs\nthat were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n\n16:8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green\nwiths which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.\n\n16:9 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the\nchamber.\n\nAnd she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he\nbrake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the\nfire. So his strength was not known.\n\n16:10 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and\ntold me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be\nbound.\n\n16:11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that\nnever were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n\n16:12 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and\nsaid unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were\nliers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his\narms like a thread.\n\n16:13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and\ntold me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said\nunto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.\n\n16:14 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The\nPhilistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and\nwent away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.\n\n16:15 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when\nthine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and\nhast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.\n\n16:16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words,\nand urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; 16:17 That he\ntold her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor\nupon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's\nwomb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall\nbecome weak, and be like any other man.\n\n16:18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she\nsent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this\nonce, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the\nPhilistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.\n\n16:19 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man,\nand she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she\nbegan to afflict him, and his strength went from him.\n\n16:20 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke\nout of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before,\nand shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.\n\n16:21 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought\nhim down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did\ngrind in the prison house.\n\n16:22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was\nshaven.\n\n16:23 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to\noffer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they\nsaid, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.\n\n16:24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they\nsaid, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the\ndestroyer of our country, which slew many of us.\n\n16:25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they\nsaid, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for\nSamson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set\nhim between the pillars.\n\n16:26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer\nme that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I\nmay lean upon them.\n\n16:27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of\nthe Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three\nthousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.\n\n16:28 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember\nme, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O\nGod, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.\n\n16:29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the\nhouse stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right\nhand, and of the other with his left.\n\n16:30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed\nhimself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and\nupon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at\nhis death were more than they which he slew in his life.\n\n16:31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and\ntook him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol\nin the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty\nyears.\n\n17:1 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\n\n17:2 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver\nthat were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of\nalso in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his\nmother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.\n\n17:3 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to\nhis mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto\nthe LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten\nimage: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.\n\n17:4 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took\ntwo hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made\nthereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house\nof Micah.\n\n17:5 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and\nteraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.\n\n17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that\nwhich was right in his own eyes.\n\n17:7 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of\nJudah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.\n\n17:8 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to\nsojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to\nthe house of Micah, as he journeyed.\n\n17:9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto\nhim, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may\nfind a place.\n\n17:10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father\nand a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year,\nand a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.\n\n17:11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young\nman was unto him as one of his sons.\n\n17:12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his\npriest, and was in the house of Micah.\n\n17:13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,\nseeing I have a Levite to my priest.\n\n18:1 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the\ntribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto\nthat day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the\ntribes of Israel.\n\n18:2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their\ncoasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the\nland, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land:\nwho when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they\nlodged there.\n\n18:3 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the\nyoung man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him,\nWho brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what\nhast thou here?  18:4 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth\nMicah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.\n\n18:5 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that\nwe may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.\n\n18:6 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is\nyour way wherein ye go.\n\n18:7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people\nthat were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the\nZidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land,\nthat might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the\nZidonians, and had no business with any man.\n\n18:8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their\nbrethren said unto them, What say ye?  18:9 And they said, Arise, that\nwe may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it\nis very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to\npossess the land.\n\n18:10 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large\nland: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no\nwant of any thing that is in the earth.\n\n18:11 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of\nZorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of\nwar.\n\n18:12 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:\nwherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it\nis behind Kirjathjearim.\n\n18:13 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the\nhouse of Micah.\n\n18:14 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of\nLaish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these\nhouses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?\nnow therefore consider what ye have to do.\n\n18:15 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young\nman the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.\n\n18:16 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,\nwhich were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.\n\n18:17 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came\nin thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the\nteraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering\nof the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons\nof war.\n\n18:18 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image,\nthe ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the\npriest unto them, What do ye?  18:19 And they said unto him, Hold thy\npeace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a\nfather and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the\nhouse of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family\nin Israel?  18:20 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the\nephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst\nof the people.\n\n18:21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the\ncattle and the carriage before them.\n\n18:22 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men\nthat were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together,\nand overtook the children of Dan.\n\n18:23 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their\nfaces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with\nsuch a company?  18:24 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I\nmade, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and\nwhat is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?  18:25 And the\nchildren of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us,\nlest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the\nlives of thy household.\n\n18:26 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that\nthey were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.\n\n18:27 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest\nwhich he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet\nand secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt\nthe city with fire.\n\n18:28 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and\nthey had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth\nby Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.\n\n18:29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan\ntheir father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city\nwas Laish at the first.\n\n18:30 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,\nthe son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests\nto the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.\n\n18:31 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all\nthe time that the house of God was in Shiloh.\n\n19:1 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in\nIsrael, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of\nmount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.\n\n19:2 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away\nfrom him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four\nwhole months.\n\n19:3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto\nher, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple\nof asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the\nfather of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.\n\n19:4 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he\nabode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged\nthere.\n\n19:5 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in\nthe morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said\nunto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and\nafterward go your way.\n\n19:6 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together:\nfor the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray\nthee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.\n\n19:7 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:\ntherefore he lodged there again.\n\n19:8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and\nthe damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they\ntarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.\n\n19:9 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and\nhis servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him,\nBehold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all\nnight: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart\nmay be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou\nmayest go home.\n\n19:10 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and\ndeparted, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there\nwere with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.\n\n19:11 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the\nservant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in\ninto this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.\n\n19:12 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into\nthe city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will\npass over to Gibeah.\n\n19:13 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one\nof these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.\n\n19:14 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down\nupon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.\n\n19:15 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah:\nand when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for\nthere was no man that took them into his house to lodging.\n\n19:16 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the\nfield at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in\nGibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.\n\n19:17 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in\nthe street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and\nwhence comest thou?  19:18 And he said unto him, We are passing from\nBethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and\nI went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD;\nand there is no man that receiveth me to house.\n\n19:19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there\nis bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young\nman which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.\n\n19:20 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy\nwants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.\n\n19:21 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the\nasses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.\n\n19:22 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of\nthe city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and\nbeat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man,\nsaying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may\nknow him.\n\n19:23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and\nsaid unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;\nseeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.\n\n19:24 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I\nwill bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth\ngood unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.\n\n19:25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his\nconcubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and\nabused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to\nspring, they let her go.\n\n19:26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at\nthe door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.\n\n19:27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the\nhouse, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his\nconcubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were\nupon the threshold.\n\n19:28 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none\nanswered.\n\nThen the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him\nunto his place.\n\n19:29 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid\nhold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into\ntwelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.\n\n19:30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed\ndone nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of\nthe land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and\nspeak your minds.\n\n20:1 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation\nwas gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the\nland of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.\n\n20:2 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of\nIsrael, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,\nfour hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.\n\n20:3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel\nwere gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us,\nhow was this wickedness?  20:4 And the Levite, the husband of the\nwoman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that\nbelongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.\n\n20:5 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round\nabout upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine\nhave they forced, that she is dead.\n\n20:6 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her\nthroughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have\ncommitted lewdness and folly in Israel.\n\n20:7 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and\ncounsel.\n\n20:8 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of\nus go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.\n\n20:9 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we\nwill go up by lot against it; 20:10 And we will take ten men of an\nhundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a\nthousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the\npeople, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,\naccording to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.\n\n20:11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit\ntogether as one man.\n\n20:12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of\nBenjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?\n20:13 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which\nare in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from\nIsrael. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of\ntheir brethren the children of Israel.\n\n20:14 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of\nthe cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of\nIsrael.\n\n20:15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of\nthe cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the\ninhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.\n\n20:16 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men\nlefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not\nmiss.\n\n20:17 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four\nhundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.\n\n20:18 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of\nGod, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first\nto the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said,\nJudah shall go up first.\n\n20:19 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped\nagainst Gibeah.\n\n20:20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and\nthe men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at\nGibeah.\n\n20:21 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and\ndestroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two\nthousand men.\n\n20:22 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set\ntheir battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in\narray the first day.\n\n20:23 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD\nuntil even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again\nto battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD\nsaid, Go up against him.)  20:24 And the children of Israel came near\nagainst the children of Benjamin the second day.\n\n20:25 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second\nday, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again\neighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.\n\n20:26 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,\nand came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the\nLORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and\npeace offerings before the LORD.\n\n20:27 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of\nthe covenant of God was there in those days, 20:28 And Phinehas, the\nson of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,)\nsaying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of\nBenjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for\nto morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.\n\n20:29 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.\n\n20:30 And the children of Israel went up against the children of\nBenjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah,\nas at other times.\n\n20:31 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and\nwere drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people,\nand kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to\nthe house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty\nmen of Israel.\n\n20:32 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before\nus, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and\ndraw them from the city unto the highways.\n\n20:33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put\nthemselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came\nforth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.\n\n20:34 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all\nIsrael, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near\nthem.\n\n20:35 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of\nIsrael destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand\nand an hundred men: all these drew the sword.\n\n20:36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the\nmen of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto\nthe liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.\n\n20:37 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the\nliers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the\nedge of the sword.\n\n20:38 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and\nthe liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise\nup out of the city.\n\n20:39 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began\nto smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they\nsaid, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.\n\n20:40 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a\npillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the\nflame of the city ascended up to heaven.\n\n20:41 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin\nwere amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.\n\n20:42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto\nthe way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them\nwhich came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.\n\n20:43 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them,\nand trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the\nsunrising.\n\n20:44 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were\nmen of valour.\n\n20:45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of\nRimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men;\nand pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of\nthem.\n\n20:46 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five\nthousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.\n\n20:47 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the\nrock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.\n\n20:48 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of\nBenjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men\nof every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set\non fire all the cities that they came to.\n\n21:1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall\nnot any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.\n\n21:2 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till\neven before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 21:3 And\nsaid, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that\nthere should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?  21:4 And it came\nto pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an\naltar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.\n\n21:5 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the\ntribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?\nFor they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the\nLORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.\n\n21:6 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their\nbrother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.\n\n21:7 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have\nsworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to\nwives?  21:8 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel\nthat came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none\nto the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.\n\n21:9 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the\ninhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.\n\n21:10 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the\nvaliantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants\nof Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the\nchildren.\n\n21:11 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy\nevery male, and every woman that hath lain by man.\n\n21:12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four\nhundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male:\nand they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of\nCanaan.\n\n21:13 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of\nBenjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto\nthem.\n\n21:14 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives\nwhich they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so\nthey sufficed them not.\n\n21:15 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD\nhad made a breach in the tribes of Israel.\n\n21:16 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for\nwives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of\nBenjamin?  21:17 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them\nthat be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of\nIsrael.\n\n21:18 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the\nchildren of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife\nto Benjamin.\n\n21:19 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh\nyearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east\nside of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the\nsouth of Lebonah.\n\n21:20 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go\nand lie in wait in the vineyards; 21:21 And see, and, behold, if the\ndaughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of\nthe vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of\nShiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.\n\n21:22 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto\nus to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them\nfor our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the\nwar: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be\nguilty.\n\n21:23 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,\naccording to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and\nthey went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the\ncities, and dwelt in them.\n\n21:24 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every\nman to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence\nevery man to his inheritance.\n\n21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that\nwhich was right in his own eyes.\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of Ruth\n\n\n1:1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there\nwas a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to\nsojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.\n\n1:2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife\nNaomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of\nBethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued\nthere.\n\n1:3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two\nsons.\n\n1:4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one\nwas Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there\nabout ten years.\n\n1:5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was\nleft of her two sons and her husband.\n\n1:6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return\nfrom the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how\nthat the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.\n\n1:7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her\ntwo daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto\nthe land of Judah.\n\n1:8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to\nher mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt\nwith the dead, and with me.\n\n1:9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house\nof her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice,\nand wept.\n\n1:10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy\npeople.\n\n1:11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?\nare there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your\nhusbands?  1:12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too\nold to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have\nan husband also to night, and should also bear sons; 1:13 Would ye\ntarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from\nhaving husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your\nsakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.\n\n1:14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed\nher mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.\n\n1:15 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her\npeople, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.\n\n1:16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from\nfollowing after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where\nthou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God\nmy God: 1:17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried:\nthe LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and\nme.\n\n1:18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then\nshe left speaking unto her.\n\n1:19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to\npass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved\nabout them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  1:20 And she said unto\nthem, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt\nvery bitterly with me.\n\n1:21 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:\nwhy then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me,\nand the Almighty hath afflicted me?  1:22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth\nthe Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of\nthe country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of\nbarley harvest.\n\n2:1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,\nof the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.\n\n2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the\nfield, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find\ngrace.\n\nAnd she said unto her, Go, my daughter.\n\n2:3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the\nreapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging\nunto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.\n\n2:4 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,\nThe LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.\n\n2:5 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,\nWhose damsel is this?  2:6 And the servant that was set over the\nreapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back\nwith Naomi out of the country of Moab: 2:7 And she said, I pray you,\nlet me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she\ncame, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she\ntarried a little in the house.\n\n2:8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to\nglean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by\nmy maidens: 2:9 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and\ngo thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall\nnot touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and\ndrink of that which the young men have drawn.\n\n2:10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and\nsaid unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou\nshouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?  2:11 And Boaz\nanswered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that\nthou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine\nhusband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the\nland of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest\nnot heretofore.\n\n2:12 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of\nthe LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.\n\n2:13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that\nthou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto\nthine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.\n\n2:14 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of\nthe bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the\nreapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was\nsufficed, and left.\n\n2:15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,\nsaying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:\n2:16 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and\nleave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.\n\n2:17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had\ngleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.\n\n2:18 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law\nsaw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that\nshe had reserved after she was sufficed.\n\n2:19 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to\nday?  and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge\nof thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought,\nand said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.\n\n2:20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the\nLORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the\ndead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of\nour next kinsmen.\n\n2:21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt\nkeep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.\n\n2:22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my\ndaughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not\nin any other field.\n\n2:23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of\nbarley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.\n\n3:1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I\nnot seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?  3:2 And now is\nnot Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  Behold, he\nwinnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.\n\n3:3 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon\nthee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto\nthe man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.\n\n3:4 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the\nplace where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet,\nand lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.\n\n3:5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.\n\n3:6 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that\nher mother in law bade her.\n\n3:7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he\nwent to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly,\nand uncovered his feet, and laid her down.\n\n3:8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and\nturned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.\n\n3:9 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine\nhandmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art\na near kinsman.\n\n3:10 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou\nhast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning,\ninasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.\n\n3:11 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou\nrequirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a\nvirtuous woman.\n\n3:12 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a\nkinsman nearer than I.\n\n3:13 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will\nperform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the\nkinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee,\nthen will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie\ndown until the morning.\n\n3:14 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before\none could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman\ncame into the floor.\n\n3:15 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold\nit.\n\nAnd when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it\non her: and she went into the city.\n\n3:16 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou,\nmy daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.\n\n3:17 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he\nsaid to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.\n\n3:18 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the\nmatter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have\nfinished the thing this day.\n\n4:1 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,\nbehold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho,\nsuch a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat\ndown.\n\n4:2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye\ndown here. And they sat down.\n\n4:3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the\ncountry of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother\nElimelech's: 4:4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it\nbefore the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou\nwilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell\nme, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I\nam after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.\n\n4:5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of\nNaomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the\ndead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.\n\n4:6 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar\nmine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot\nredeem it.\n\n4:7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning\nredeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man\nplucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a\ntestimony in Israel.\n\n4:8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew\noff his shoe.\n\n4:9 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are\nwitnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and\nall that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.\n\n4:10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased\nto be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,\nthat the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and\nfrom the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.\n\n4:11 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said,\nWe are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine\nhouse like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of\nIsrael: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:\n4:12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare\nunto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young\nwoman.\n\n4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto\nher, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.\n\n4:14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath\nnot left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous\nin Israel.\n\n4:15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher\nof thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is\nbetter to thee than seven sons, hath born him.\n\n4:16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became\nnurse unto it.\n\n4:17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a\nson born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of\nJesse, the father of David.\n\n4:18 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,\n4:19 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 4:20 And Amminadab\nbegat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 4:21 And Salmon begat Boaz,\nand Boaz begat Obed, 4:22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.\n\n\n\n\nThe First Book of Samuel\n\nOtherwise Called:\n\nThe First Book of the Kings\n\n\n1:1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,\nand his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the\nson of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 1:2 And he had two wives;\nthe name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah:\nand Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.\n\n1:3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to\nsacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,\nHophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.\n\n1:4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah\nhis wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 1:5 But\nunto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the\nLORD had shut up her womb.\n\n1:6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,\nbecause the LORD had shut up her womb.\n\n1:7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of\nthe LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.\n\n1:8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?\nand why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better\nto thee than ten sons?  1:9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in\nShiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat\nby a post of the temple of the LORD.\n\n1:10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and\nwept sore.\n\n1:11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt\nindeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and\nnot forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man\nchild, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,\nand there shall no razor come upon his head.\n\n1:12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,\nthat Eli marked her mouth.\n\n1:13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her\nvoice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.\n\n1:14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away\nthy wine from thee.\n\n1:15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a\nsorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have\npoured out my soul before the LORD.\n\n1:16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the\nabundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.\n\n1:17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel\ngrant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.\n\n1:18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the\nwoman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.\n\n1:19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the\nLORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew\nHannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.\n\n1:20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after\nHannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,\nsaying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.\n\n1:21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the\nLORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.\n\n1:22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not\ngo up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he\nmay appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.\n\n1:23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;\ntarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So\nthe woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.\n\n1:24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three\nbullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought\nhim unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.\n\n1:25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.\n\n1:26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the\nwoman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.\n\n1:27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition\nwhich I asked of him: 1:28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD;\nas long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped\nthe LORD there.\n\n2:1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine\nhorn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;\nbecause I rejoice in thy salvation.\n\n2:2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:\nneither is there any rock like our God.\n\n2:3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of\nyour mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are\nweighed.\n\n2:4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are\ngirded with strength.\n\n2:5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they\nthat were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she\nthat hath many children is waxed feeble.\n\n2:6 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave,\nand bringeth up.\n\n2:7 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and\nlifteth up.\n\n2:8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar\nfrom the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit\nthe throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and\nhe hath set the world upon them.\n\n2:9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be\nsilent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.\n\n2:10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of\nheaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of\nthe earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the\nhorn of his anointed.\n\n2:11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did\nminister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.\n\n2:12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.\n\n2:13 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man\noffered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in\nseething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 2:14 And he\nstruck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the\nfleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in\nShiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.\n\n2:15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and\nsaid to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest;\nfor he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.\n\n2:16 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat\npresently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would\nanswer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will\ntake it by force.\n\n2:17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the\nLORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.\n\n2:18 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with\na linen ephod.\n\n2:19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him\nfrom year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the\nyearly sacrifice.\n\n2:20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give\nthee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And\nthey went unto their own home.\n\n2:21 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare\nthree sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the\nLORD.\n\n2:22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all\nIsrael; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n2:23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your\nevil dealings by all this people.\n\n2:24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the\nLORD's people to transgress.\n\n2:25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if\na man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding\nthey hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD\nwould slay them.\n\n2:26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the\nLORD, and also with men.\n\n2:27 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus\nsaith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,\nwhen they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?  2:28 And did I choose him\nout of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine\naltar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give\nunto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the\nchildren of Israel?  2:29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at\nmine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest\nthy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the\nofferings of Israel my people?  2:30 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel\nsaith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father,\nshould walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from\nme; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me\nshall be lightly esteemed.\n\n2:31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm\nof thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine\nhouse.\n\n2:32 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth\nwhich God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in\nthine house for ever.\n\n2:33 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,\nshall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the\nincrease of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.\n\n2:34 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two\nsons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.\n\n2:35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according\nto that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a\nsure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.\n\n2:36 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine\nhouse shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel\nof bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests'\noffices, that I may eat a piece of bread.\n\n3:1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the\nword of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.\n\n3:2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his\nplace, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; 3:3 And\nere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark\nof God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; 3:4 That the LORD\ncalled Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.\n\n3:5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.\nAnd he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.\n\n3:6 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went\nto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered,\nI called not, my son; lie down again.\n\n3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the\nLORD yet revealed unto him.\n\n3:8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and\nwent to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli\nperceived that the LORD had called the child.\n\n3:9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if\nhe call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant\nheareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\n\n3:10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,\nSamuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.\n\n3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,\nat which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.\n\n3:12 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have\nspoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.\n\n3:13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the\niniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and\nhe restrained them not.\n\n3:14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the\niniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor\noffering for ever.\n\n3:15 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the\nhouse of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.\n\n3:16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he\nanswered, Here am I.\n\n3:17 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?\nI pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if\nthou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.\n\n3:18 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he\nsaid, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.\n\n3:19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of\nhis words fall to the ground.\n\n3:20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was\nestablished to be a prophet of the LORD.\n\n3:21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed\nhimself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.\n\n4:1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out\nagainst the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and\nthe Philistines pitched in Aphek.\n\n4:2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and\nwhen they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines:\nand they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.\n\n4:3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel\nsaid, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the\nPhilistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of\nShiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of\nthe hand of our enemies.\n\n4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence\nthe ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between\nthe cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were\nthere with the ark of the covenant of God.\n\n4:5 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,\nall Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\n\n4:6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,\nWhat meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?\nAnd they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.\n\n4:7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into\nthe camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a\nthing heretofore.\n\n4:8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty\nGods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues\nin the wilderness.\n\n4:9 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye\nbe not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit\nyourselves like men, and fight.\n\n4:10 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled\nevery man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for\nthere fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.\n\n4:11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and\nPhinehas, were slain.\n\n4:12 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to\nShiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his\nhead.\n\n4:13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside\nwatching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man\ncame into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.\n\n4:14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth\nthe noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.\n\n4:15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,\nthat he could not see.\n\n4:16 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and\nI fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my\nson?  4:17 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before\nthe Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the\npeople, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the\nark of God is taken.\n\n4:18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that\nhe fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his\nneck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had\njudged Israel forty years.\n\n4:19 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to\nbe delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was\ntaken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed\nherself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.\n\n4:20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said\nunto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not,\nneither did she regard it.\n\n4:21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed\nfrom Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her\nfather in law and her husband.\n\n4:22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of\nGod is taken.\n\n5:1 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from\nEbenezer unto Ashdod.\n\n5:2 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the\nhouse of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.\n\n5:3 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon\nwas fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And\nthey took Dagon, and set him in his place again.\n\n5:4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was\nfallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the\nhead of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the\nthreshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.\n\n5:5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into\nDagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this\nday.\n\n5:6 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he\ndestroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the\ncoasts thereof.\n\n5:7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark\nof the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore\nupon us, and upon Dagon our god.\n\n5:8 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines\nunto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of\nIsrael? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried\nabout unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about\nthither.\n\n5:9 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of\nthe LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he\nsmote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods\nin their secret parts.\n\n5:10 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,\nas the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,\nThey have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us\nand our people.\n\n5:11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the\nPhilistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let\nit go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for\nthere was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of\nGod was very heavy there.\n\n5:12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the\ncry of the city went up to heaven.\n\n6:1 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines\nseven months.\n\n6:2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,\nsaying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we\nshall send it to his place.\n\n6:3 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send\nit not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye\nshall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not\nremoved from you.\n\n6:4 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall\nreturn to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden\nmice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one\nplague was on you all, and on your lords.\n\n6:5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your\nmice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of\nIsrael: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from\noff your gods, and from off your land.\n\n6:6 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and\nPharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among\nthem, did they not let the people go, and they departed?  6:7 Now\ntherefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there\nhath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their\ncalves home from them: 6:8 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it\nupon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a\ntrespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,\nthat it may go.\n\n6:9 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to\nBethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we\nshall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that\nhappened to us.\n\n6:10 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the\ncart, and shut up their calves at home: 6:11 And they laid the ark of\nthe LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the\nimages of their emerods.\n\n6:12 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and\nwent along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to\nthe right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went\nafter them unto the border of Bethshemesh.\n\n6:13 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the\nvalley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced\nto see it.\n\n6:14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and\nstood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of\nthe cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.\n\n6:15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer\nthat was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the\ngreat stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and\nsacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.\n\n6:16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they\nreturned to Ekron the same day.\n\n6:17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned\nfor a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,\nfor Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 6:18 And the golden\nmice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines\nbelonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country\nvillages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the\nark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of\nJoshua, the Bethshemite.\n\n6:19 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into\nthe ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and\nthreescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had\nsmitten many of the people with a great slaughter.\n\n6:20 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this\nholy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?  6:21 And they sent\nmessengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The\nPhilistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and\nfetch it up to you.\n\n7:1 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the\nLORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and\nsanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.\n\n7:2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that\nthe time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of\nIsrael lamented after the LORD.\n\n7:3 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do\nreturn unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange\ngods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the\nLORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of\nthe Philistines.\n\n7:4 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and\nserved the LORD only.\n\n7:5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for\nyou unto the LORD.\n\n7:6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured\nit out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We\nhave sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel\nin Mizpeh.\n\n7:7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were\ngathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up\nagainst Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were\nafraid of the Philistines.\n\n7:8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto\nthe LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the\nPhilistines.\n\n7:9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt\noffering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for\nIsrael; and the LORD heard him.\n\n7:10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines\ndrew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a\ngreat thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them;\nand they were smitten before Israel.\n\n7:11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the\nPhilistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.\n\n7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and\ncalled the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped\nus.\n\n7:13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the\ncoast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines\nall the days of Samuel.\n\n7:14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were\nrestored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof\ndid Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was\npeace between Israel and the Amorites.\n\n7:15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.\n\n7:16 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,\nand Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.\n\n7:17 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there\nhe judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.\n\n8:1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons\njudges over Israel.\n\n8:2 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his\nsecond, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.\n\n8:3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,\nand took bribes, and perverted judgment.\n\n8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and\ncame to Samuel unto Ramah, 8:5 And said unto him, Behold, thou art\nold, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us\nlike all the nations.\n\n8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to\njudge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.\n\n8:7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the\npeople in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected\nthee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.\n\n8:8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that\nI brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have\nforsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.\n\n8:9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest\nsolemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall\nreign over them.\n\n8:10 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that\nasked of him a king.\n\n8:11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign\nover you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for\nhis chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his\nchariots.\n\n8:12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains\nover fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his\nharvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his\nchariots.\n\n8:13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be\ncooks, and to be bakers.\n\n8:14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your\noliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.\n\n8:15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,\nand give to his officers, and to his servants.\n\n8:16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and\nyour goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.\n\n8:17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his\nservants.\n\n8:18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye\nshall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.\n\n8:19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and\nthey said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 8:20 That we also may\nbe like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out\nbefore us, and fight our battles.\n\n8:21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed\nthem in the ears of the LORD.\n\n8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make\nthem a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man\nunto his city.\n\n9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of\nAbiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a\nBenjamite, a mighty man of power.\n\n9:2 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a\ngoodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier\nperson than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any\nof the people.\n\n9:3 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to\nSaul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go\nseek the asses.\n\n9:4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land\nof Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the\nland of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the\nland of the Benjamites, but they found them not.\n\n9:5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his\nservant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father\nleave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.\n\n9:6 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of\nGod, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to\npass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that\nwe should go.\n\n9:7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall\nwe bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is\nnot a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?  9:8 And the\nservant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the\nfourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God,\nto tell us our way.\n\n9:9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he\nspake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a\nProphet was beforetime called a Seer.)  9:10 Then said Saul to his\nservant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where\nthe man of God was.\n\n9:11 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young\nmaidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?\n9:12 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before\nyou: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a\nsacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 9:13 As soon as ye\nbe come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up\nto the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come,\nbecause he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be\nbidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find\nhim.\n\n9:14 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the\ncity, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high\nplace.\n\n9:15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,\nsaying, 9:16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of\nthe land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my\npeople Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the\nPhilistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is\ncome unto me.\n\n9:17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man\nwhom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.\n\n9:18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I\npray thee, where the seer's house is.\n\n9:19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before\nme unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow\nI will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.\n\n9:20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy\nmind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of\nIsrael? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?  9:21 And\nSaul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the\ntribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the\ntribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?  9:22 And\nSamuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour,\nand made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden,\nwhich were about thirty persons.\n\n9:23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave\nthee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.\n\n9:24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,\nand set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!\nset it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for\nthee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with\nSamuel that day.\n\n9:25 And when they were come down from the high place into the city,\nSamuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.\n\n9:26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the\nday, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that\nI may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them,\nhe and Samuel, abroad.\n\n9:27 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said\nto Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but\nstand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.\n\n10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and\nkissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to\nbe captain over his inheritance?  10:2 When thou art departed from me\nto day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the\nborder of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses\nwhich thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left\nthe care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do\nfor my son?  10:3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou\nshalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men\ngoing up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another\ncarrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:\n10:4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;\nwhich thou shalt receive of their hands.\n\n10:5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the\ngarrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art\ncome thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets\ncoming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a\npipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: 10:6 And the\nSpirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with\nthem, and shalt be turned into another man.\n\n10:7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do\nas occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.\n\n10:8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will\ncome down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice\nsacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I\ncome to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.\n\n10:9 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from\nSamuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass\nthat day.\n\n10:10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of\nprophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he\nprophesied among them.\n\n10:11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,\nbehold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to\nanother, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also\namong the prophets?  10:12 And one of the same place answered and\nsaid, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul\nalso among the prophets?  10:13 And when he had made an end of\nprophesying, he came to the high place.\n\n10:14 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went\nye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no\nwhere, we came to Samuel.\n\n10:15 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said\nunto you.\n\n10:16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses\nwere found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he\ntold him not.\n\n10:17 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;\n10:18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of\nIsrael, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the\nhand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of\nthem that oppressed you: 10:19 And ye have this day rejected your God,\nwho himself saved you out of all your adversities and your\ntribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.\nNow therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and\nby your thousands.\n\n10:20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come\nnear, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.\n\n10:21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their\nfamilies, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was\ntaken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.\n\n10:22 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should\nyet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself\namong the stuff.\n\n10:23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the\npeople, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and\nupward.\n\n10:24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath\nchosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the\npeople shouted, and said, God save the king.\n\n10:25 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote\nit in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the\npeople away, every man to his house.\n\n10:26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a\nband of men, whose hearts God had touched.\n\n10:27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And\nthey despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.\n\n11:1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against\nJabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a\ncovenant with us, and we will serve thee.\n\n11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I\nmake a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes,\nand lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.\n\n11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'\nrespite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel:\nand then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.\n\n11:4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings\nin the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices,\nand wept.\n\n11:5 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul\nsaid, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the\ntidings of the men of Jabesh.\n\n11:6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,\nand his anger was kindled greatly.\n\n11:7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent\nthem throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers,\nsaying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so\nshall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the\npeople, and they came out with one consent.\n\n11:8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were\nthree hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.\n\n11:9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say\nunto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot,\nye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men\nof Jabesh; and they were glad.\n\n11:10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out\nunto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.\n\n11:11 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three\ncompanies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning\nwatch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came\nto pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them\nwere not left together.\n\n11:12 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul\nreign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.\n\n11:13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:\nfor to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.\n\n11:14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,\nand renew the kingdom there.\n\n11:15 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king\nbefore the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of\npeace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of\nIsrael rejoiced greatly.\n\n12:1 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto\nyour voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.\n\n12:2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and\ngrayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked\nbefore you from my childhood unto this day.\n\n12:3 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before\nhis anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or\nwhom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I\nreceived any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it\nyou.\n\n12:4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,\nneither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.\n\n12:5 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his\nanointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.\nAnd they answered, He is witness.\n\n12:6 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced\nMoses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of\nEgypt.\n\n12:7 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the\nLORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to\nyour fathers.\n\n12:8 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the\nLORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your\nfathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.\n\n12:9 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the\nhand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the\nPhilistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought\nagainst them.\n\n12:10 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because\nwe have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but\nnow deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.\n\n12:11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and\nSamuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every\nside, and ye dwelled safe.\n\n12:12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon\ncame against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over\nus: when the LORD your God was your king.\n\n12:13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye\nhave desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.\n\n12:14 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and\nnot rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and\nalso the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your\nGod: 12:15 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel\nagainst the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD\nbe against you, as it was against your fathers.\n\n12:16 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD\nwill do before your eyes.\n\n12:17 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and\nhe shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your\nwickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in\nasking you a king.\n\n12:18 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and\nrain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.\n\n12:19 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto\nthe LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins\nthis evil, to ask us a king.\n\n12:20 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this\nwickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the\nLORD with all your heart; 12:21 And turn ye not aside: for then should\nye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are\nvain.\n\n12:22 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's\nsake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.\n\n12:23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the\nLORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the\nright way: 12:24 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all\nyour heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.\n\n12:25 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye\nand your king.\n\n13:1 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over\nIsrael, 13:2 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two\nthousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a\nthousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the\npeople he sent every man to his tent.\n\n13:3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in\nGeba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet\nthroughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.\n\n13:4 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the\nPhilistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the\nPhilistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.\n\n13:5 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with\nIsrael, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and\npeople as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they\ncame up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.\n\n13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the\npeople were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves,\nand in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.\n\n13:7 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and\nGilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed\nhim trembling.\n\n13:8 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel\nhad appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were\nscattered from him.\n\n13:9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace\nofferings. And he offered the burnt offering.\n\n13:10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of\noffering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to\nmeet him, that he might salute him.\n\n13:11 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I\nsaw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not\nwithin the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered\nthemselves together at Michmash; 13:12 Therefore said I, The\nPhilistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made\nsupplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a\nburnt offering.\n\n13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not\nkept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for\nnow would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.\n\n13:14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him\na man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be\ncaptain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the\nLORD commanded thee.\n\n13:15 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of\nBenjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him,\nabout six hundred men.\n\n13:16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present\nwith them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped\nin Michmash.\n\n13:17 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in\nthree companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to\nOphrah, unto the land of Shual: 13:18 And another company turned the\nway to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border\nthat looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.\n\n13:19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:\nfor the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:\n13:20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen\nevery man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.\n\n13:21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and\nfor the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.\n\n13:22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither\nsword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with\nSaul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there\nfound.\n\n13:23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of\nMichmash.\n\n14:1 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul\nsaid unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over\nto the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told\nnot his father.\n\n14:2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a\npomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him\nwere about six hundred men; 14:3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub,\nIchabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's\npriest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that\nJonathan was gone.\n\n14:4 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over\nunto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one\nside, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was\nBozez, and the name of the other Seneh.\n\n14:5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against\nMichmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.\n\n14:6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,\nand let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be\nthat the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD\nto save by many or by few.\n\n14:7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine\nheart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.\n\n14:8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and\nwe will discover ourselves unto them.\n\n14:9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we\nwill stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.\n\n14:10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for\nthe LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign\nunto us.\n\n14:11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the\nPhilistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth\nout of the holes where they had hid themselves.\n\n14:12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his\narmourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.\nAnd Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the\nLORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.\n\n14:13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and\nhis armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his\narmourbearer slew after him.\n\n14:14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer\nmade, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,\nwhich a yoke of oxen might plow.\n\n14:15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all\nthe people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and\nthe earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.\n\n14:16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,\nbehold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one\nanother.\n\n14:17 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,\nand see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold,\nJonathan and his armourbearer were not there.\n\n14:18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the\nark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.\n\n14:19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the\nnoise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased:\nand Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.\n\n14:20 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled\nthemselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's\nsword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.\n\n14:21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that\ntime, which went up with them into the camp from the country round\nabout, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with\nSaul and Jonathan.\n\n14:22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount\nEphraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also\nfollowed hard after them in the battle.\n\n14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over\nunto Bethaven.\n\n14:24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had\nadjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food\nuntil evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the\npeople tasted any food.\n\n14:25 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey\nupon the ground.\n\n14:26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey\ndropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared\nthe oath.\n\n14:27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with\nthe oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his\nhand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth;\nand his eyes were enlightened.\n\n14:28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly\ncharged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth\nany food this day. And the people were faint.\n\n14:29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I\npray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a\nlittle of this honey.\n\n14:30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of\nthe spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been\nnow a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?  14:31 And they\nsmote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the\npeople were very faint.\n\n14:32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,\nand calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them\nwith the blood.\n\n14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the\nLORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have\ntransgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.\n\n14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say\nunto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,\nand slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating\nwith the blood.\n\nAnd all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and\nslew them there.\n\n14:35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first\naltar that he built unto the LORD.\n\n14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,\nand spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of\nthem. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said\nthe priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.\n\n14:37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the\nPhilistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he\nanswered him not that day.\n\n14:38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people:\nand know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.\n\n14:39 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in\nJonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among\nall the people that answered him.\n\n14:40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and\nJonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto\nSaul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.\n\n14:41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect\nlot.\n\nAnd Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.\n\n14:42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And\nJonathan was taken.\n\n14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And\nJonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the\nend of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.\n\n14:44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt\nsurely die, Jonathan.\n\n14:45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath\nwrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD\nliveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for\nhe hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan,\nthat he died not.\n\n14:46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the\nPhilistines went to their own place.\n\n14:47 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his\nenemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of\nAmmon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against\nthe Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.\n\n14:48 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered\nIsrael out of the hands of them that spoiled them.\n\n14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:\nand the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the\nfirstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 14:50 And the\nname of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name\nof the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.\n\n14:51 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was\nthe son of Abiel.\n\n14:52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of\nSaul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took\nhim unto him.\n\n15:1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be\nking over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the\nvoice of the words of the LORD.\n\n15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to\nIsrael, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from\nEgypt.\n\n15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,\nand spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,\nox and sheep, camel and ass.\n\n15:4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in\nTelaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.\n\n15:5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.\n\n15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from\namong the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed\nkindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of\nEgypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.\n\n15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to\nShur, that is over against Egypt.\n\n15:8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly\ndestroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.\n\n15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,\nand of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was\ngood, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was\nvile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.\n\n15:10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 15:11 It\nrepenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back\nfrom following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it\ngrieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.\n\n15:12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was\ntold Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a\nplace, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.\n\n15:13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou\nof the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.\n\n15:14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in\nmine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?  15:15 And Saul\nsaid, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people\nspared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the\nLORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.\n\n15:16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the\nLORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.\n\n15:17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast\nthou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed\nthee king over Israel?  15:18 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and\nsaid, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight\nagainst them until they be consumed.\n\n15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but\ndidst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?\n15:20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the\nLORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought\nAgag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.\n\n15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of\nthe things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto\nthe LORD thy God in Gilgal.\n\n15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt\nofferings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold,\nto obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\n\n15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is\nas iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the\nLORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.\n\n15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have\ntransgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I\nfeared the people, and obeyed their voice.\n\n15:25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with\nme, that I may worship the LORD.\n\n15:26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou\nhast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee\nfrom being king over Israel.\n\n15:27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the\nskirt of his mantle, and it rent.\n\n15:28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of\nIsrael from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,\nthat is better than thou.\n\n15:29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he\nis not a man, that he should repent.\n\n15:30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,\nbefore the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with\nme, that I may worship the LORD thy God.\n\n15:31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.\n\n15:32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the\nAmalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely\nthe bitterness of death is past.\n\n15:33 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so\nshall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in\npieces before the LORD in Gilgal.\n\n15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to\nGibeah of Saul.\n\n15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:\nnevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he\nhad made Saul king over Israel.\n\n16:1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,\nseeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn\nwith oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I\nhave provided me a king among his sons.\n\n16:2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.\nAnd the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to\nsacrifice to the LORD.\n\n16:3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou\nshalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.\n\n16:4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.\nAnd the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest\nthou peaceably?  16:5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice\nunto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.\nAnd he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the\nsacrifice.\n\n16:6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on\nEliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.\n\n16:7 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on\nthe height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD\nseeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but\nthe LORD looketh on the heart.\n\n16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And\nhe said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.\n\n16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the\nLORD chosen this.\n\n16:10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And\nSamuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.\n\n16:11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he\nsaid, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the\nsheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not\nsit down till he come hither.\n\n16:12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of\na beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said,\nArise, anoint him: for this is he.\n\n16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst\nof his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that\nday forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.\n\n16:14 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil\nspirit from the LORD troubled him.\n\n16:15 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit\nfrom God troubleth thee.\n\n16:16 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to\nseek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come\nto pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall\nplay with his hand, and thou shalt be well.\n\n16:17 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can\nplay well, and bring him to me.\n\n16:18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen\na son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a\nmighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a\ncomely person, and the LORD is with him.\n\n16:19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me\nDavid thy son, which is with the sheep.\n\n16:20 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,\nand a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.\n\n16:21 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him\ngreatly; and he became his armourbearer.\n\n16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand\nbefore me; for he hath found favour in my sight.\n\n16:23 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon\nSaul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was\nrefreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.\n\n17:1 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and\nwere gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and\npitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.\n\n17:2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and\npitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the\nPhilistines.\n\n17:3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and\nIsrael stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley\nbetween them.\n\n17:4 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,\nnamed Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.\n\n17:5 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed\nwith a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand\nshekels of brass.\n\n17:6 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass\nbetween his shoulders.\n\n17:7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his\nspear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a\nshield went before him.\n\n17:8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto\nthem, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a\nPhilistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let\nhim come down to me.\n\n17:9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be\nyour servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall\nye be our servants, and serve us.\n\n17:10 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;\ngive me a man, that we may fight together.\n\n17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,\nthey were dismayed, and greatly afraid.\n\n17:12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,\nwhose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among\nmen for an old man in the days of Saul.\n\n17:13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the\nbattle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were\nEliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third\nShammah.\n\n17:14 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.\n\n17:15 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep\nat Bethlehem.\n\n17:16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented\nhimself forty days.\n\n17:17 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an\nephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp\nof thy brethren; 17:18 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of\ntheir thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.\n\n17:19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the\nvalley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.\n\n17:20 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with\na keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came\nto the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted\nfor the battle.\n\n17:21 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army\nagainst army.\n\n17:22 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the\ncarriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.\n\n17:23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,\nthe Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the\nPhilistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard\nthem.\n\n17:24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,\nand were sore afraid.\n\n17:25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come\nup?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the\nman who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and\nwill give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in\nIsrael.\n\n17:26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall\nbe done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the\nreproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that\nhe should defy the armies of the living God?  17:27 And the people\nanswered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man\nthat killeth him.\n\n17:28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;\nand Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest\nthou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the\nwilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for\nthou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.\n\n17:29 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?\n17:30 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same\nmanner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.\n\n17:31 And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed\nthem before Saul: and he sent for him.\n\n17:32 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him;\nthy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\n\n17:33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this\nPhilistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man\nof war from his youth.\n\n17:34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,\nand there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:\n17:35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of\nhis mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard,\nand smote him, and slew him.\n\n17:36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this\nuncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath\ndefied the armies of the living God.\n\n17:37 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw\nof the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of\nthe hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the\nLORD be with thee.\n\n17:38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of\nbrass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.\n\n17:39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to\ngo; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go\nwith these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.\n\n17:40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth\nstones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he\nhad, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near\nto the Philistine.\n\n17:41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man\nthat bare the shield went before him.\n\n17:42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he\ndisdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair\ncountenance.\n\n17:43 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest\nto me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.\n\n17:44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give\nthy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.\n\n17:45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a\nsword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the\nname of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou\nhast defied.\n\n17:46 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will\nsmite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the\ncarcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the\nair, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know\nthat there is a God in Israel.\n\n17:47 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with\nsword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you\ninto our hands.\n\n17:48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and\ndrew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army\nto meet the Philistine.\n\n17:49 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and\nslang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone\nsunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.\n\n17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a\nstone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword\nin the hand of David.\n\n17:51 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his\nsword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut\noff his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion\nwas dead, they fled.\n\n17:52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and\npursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the\ngates of Ekron.\n\nAnd the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,\neven unto Gath, and unto Ekron.\n\n17:53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the\nPhilistines, and they spoiled their tents.\n\n17:54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to\nJerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.\n\n17:55 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said\nunto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?\nAnd Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.\n\n17:56 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.\n\n17:57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,\nAbner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the\nPhilistine in his hand.\n\n17:58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And\nDavid answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\n\n18:1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto\nSaul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and\nJonathan loved him as his own soul.\n\n18:2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to\nhis father's house.\n\n18:3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as\nhis own soul.\n\n18:4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and\ngave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow,\nand to his girdle.\n\n18:5 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved\nhimself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was\naccepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of\nSaul's servants.\n\n18:6 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from\nthe slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities\nof Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with\njoy, and with instruments of musick.\n\n18:7 And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul\nhath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.\n\n18:8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he\nsaid, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have\nascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?\n18:9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.\n\n18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God\ncame upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David\nplayed with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in\nSaul's hand.\n\n18:11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even\nto the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.\n\n18:12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and\nwas departed from Saul.\n\n18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain\nover a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\n\n18:14 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD\nwas with him.\n\n18:15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he\nwas afraid of him.\n\n18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and\ncame in before them.\n\n18:17 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will\nI give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's\nbattles.\n\nFor Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the\nPhilistines be upon him.\n\n18:18 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my\nfather's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?\n18:19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter\nshould have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the\nMeholathite to wife.\n\n18:20 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and\nthe thing pleased him.\n\n18:21 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to\nhim, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\nWherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in\nthe one of the twain.\n\n18:22 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David\nsecretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his\nservants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.\n\n18:23 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And\nDavid said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law,\nseeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?  18:24 And the\nservants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.\n\n18:25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not\nany dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged\nof the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand\nof the Philistines.\n\n18:26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David\nwell to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.\n\n18:27 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the\nPhilistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and\nthey gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's\nson in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.\n\n18:28 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that\nMichal Saul's daughter loved him.\n\n18:29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became\nDavid's enemy continually.\n\n18:30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to\npass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely\nthan all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.\n\n19:1 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that\nthey should kill David.\n\n19:2 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan\ntold David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now\ntherefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and\nabide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 19:3 And I will go out and\nstand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune\nwith my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.\n\n19:4 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said\nunto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David;\nbecause he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have\nbeen to thee-ward very good: 19:5 For he did put his life in his hand,\nand slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for\nall Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt\nthou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?  19:6\nAnd Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the\nLORD liveth, he shall not be slain.\n\n19:7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those\nthings.\n\nAnd Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in\ntimes past.\n\n19:8 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the\nPhilistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from\nhim.\n\n19:9 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his\nhouse with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.\n\n19:10 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the\njavelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the\njavelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.\n\n19:11 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and\nto slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying,\nIf thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.\n\n19:12 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and\nfled, and escaped.\n\n19:13 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a\npillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.\n\n19:14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is\nsick.\n\n19:15 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring\nhim up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.\n\n19:16 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image\nin the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.\n\n19:17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and\nsent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He\nsaid unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?  19:18 So David fled,\nand escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul\nhad done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.\n\n19:19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in\nRamah.\n\n19:20 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the\ncompany of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed\nover them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they\nalso prophesied.\n\n19:21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they\nprophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time,\nand they prophesied also.\n\n19:22 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in\nSechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one\nsaid, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.\n\n19:23 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God\nwas upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to\nNaioth in Ramah.\n\n19:24 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before\nSamuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that\nnight. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?  20:1 And\nDavid fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan,\nWhat have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy\nfather, that he seeketh my life?  20:2 And he said unto him, God\nforbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either\ngreat or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father\nhide this thing from me? it is not so.\n\n20:3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth\nthat I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan\nknow this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as\nthy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.\n\n20:4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I\nwill even do it for thee.\n\n20:5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon,\nand I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go,\nthat I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.\n\n20:6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked\nleave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a\nyearly sacrifice there for all the family.\n\n20:7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if\nhe be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.\n\n20:8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast\nbrought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee:\nnotwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why\nshouldest thou bring me to thy father?  20:9 And Jonathan said, Far be\nit from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my\nfather to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?  20:10 Then\nsaid David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father\nanswer thee roughly?  20:11 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and\nlet us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the\nfield.\n\n20:12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have\nsounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and,\nbehold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee,\nand shew it thee; 20:13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but\nif it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and\nsend thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with\nthee, as he hath been with my father.\n\n20:14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of\nthe LORD, that I die not: 20:15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy\nkindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off\nthe enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.\n\n20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let\nthe LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.\n\n20:17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:\nfor he loved him as he loved his own soul.\n\n20:18 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou\nshalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.\n\n20:19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down\nquickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the\nbusiness was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.\n\n20:20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I\nshot at a mark.\n\n20:21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.\nIf I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side\nof thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no\nhurt; as the LORD liveth.\n\n20:22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are\nbeyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.\n\n20:23 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,\nbehold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.\n\n20:24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was\ncome, the king sat him down to eat meat.\n\n20:25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a\nseat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side,\nand David's place was empty.\n\n20:26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,\nSomething hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.\n\n20:27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of\nthe month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan\nhis son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither\nyesterday, nor to day?  20:28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David\nearnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: 20:29 And he said, Let\nme go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and\nmy brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found\nfavour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my\nbrethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.\n\n20:30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto\nhim, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that\nthou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the\nconfusion of thy mother's nakedness?  20:31 For as long as the son of\nJesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy\nkingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely\ndie.\n\n20:32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,\nWherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?  20:33 And Saul cast a\njavelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was\ndetermined of his father to slay David.\n\n20:34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no\nmeat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David,\nbecause his father had done him shame.\n\n20:35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into\nthe field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.\n\n20:36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I\nshoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.\n\n20:37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which\nJonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the\narrow beyond thee?  20:38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make\nspeed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and\ncame to his master.\n\n20:39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the\nmatter.\n\n20:40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,\nGo, carry them to the city.\n\n20:41 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place\ntoward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed\nhimself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with\nanother, until David exceeded.\n\n20:42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have\nsworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between\nme and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose\nand departed: and Jonathan went into the city.\n\n21:1 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was\nafraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone,\nand no man with thee?  21:2 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest,\nThe king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no\nman know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I\nhave commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such\na place.\n\n21:3 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of\nbread in mine hand, or what there is present.\n\n21:4 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread\nunder mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have\nkept themselves at least from women.\n\n21:5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth\nwomen have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out,\nand the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a\nmanner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.\n\n21:6 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread\nthere but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put\nhot bread in the day when it was taken away.\n\n21:7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,\ndetained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the\nchiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.\n\n21:8 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine\nhand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my\nweapons with me, because the king's business required haste.\n\n21:9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom\nthou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a\ncloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is\nno other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give\nit me.\n\n21:10 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to\nAchish the king of Gath.\n\n21:11 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the\nking of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances,\nsaying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?\n21:12 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid\nof Achish the king of Gath.\n\n21:13 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself\nmad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let\nhis spittle fall down upon his beard.\n\n21:14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:\nwherefore then have ye brought him to me?  21:15 Have I need of mad\nmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my\npresence? shall this fellow come into my house?  22:1 David therefore\ndeparted thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his\nbrethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither\nto him.\n\n22:2 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in\ndebt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto\nhim; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about\nfour hundred men.\n\n22:3 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the\nking of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,\nand be with you, till I know what God will do for me.\n\n22:4 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with\nhim all the while that David was in the hold.\n\n22:5 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;\ndepart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and\ncame into the forest of Hareth.\n\n22:6 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were\nwith him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his\nspear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) 22:7\nThen Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye\nBenjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and\nvineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of\nhundreds; 22:8 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is\nnone that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of\nJesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto\nme that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait,\nas at this day?  22:9 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set\nover the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to\nNob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.\n\n22:10 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and\ngave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\n\n22:11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of\nAhitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and\nthey came all of them to the king.\n\n22:12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,\nHere I am, my lord.\n\n22:13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou\nand the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword,\nand hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to\nlie in wait, as at this day?  22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king,\nand said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David,\nwhich is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is\nhonourable in thine house?  22:15 Did I then begin to enquire of God\nfor him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his\nservant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew\nnothing of all this, less or more.\n\n22:16 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and\nall thy father's house.\n\n22:17 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,\nand slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with\nDavid, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.\nBut the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall\nupon the priests of the LORD.\n\n22:18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.\nAnd Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on\nthat day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.\n\n22:19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the\nsword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and\nasses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.\n\n22:20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named\nAbiathar, escaped, and fled after David.\n\n22:21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's\npriests.\n\n22:22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the\nEdomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned\nthe death of all the persons of thy father's house.\n\n22:23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life\nseeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.\n\n23:1 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight\nagainst Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.\n\n23:2 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and\nsmite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite\nthe Philistines, and save Keilah.\n\n23:3 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in\nJudah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of\nthe Philistines?  23:4 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And\nthe LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will\ndeliver the Philistines into thine hand.\n\n23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the\nPhilistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a\ngreat slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.\n\n23:6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to\nDavid to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.\n\n23:7 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul\nsaid, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by\nentering into a town that hath gates and bars.\n\n23:8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to\nKeilah, to besiege David and his men.\n\n23:9 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him;\nand he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.\n\n23:10 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath\ncertainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the\ncity for my sake.\n\n23:11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul\ncome down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech\nthee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.\n\n23:12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men\ninto the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.\n\n23:13 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and\ndeparted out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it\nwas told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go\nforth.\n\n23:14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained\nin a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every\nday, but God delivered him not into his hand.\n\n23:15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David\nwas in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.\n\n23:16 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood,\nand strengthened his hand in God.\n\n23:17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father\nshall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall\nbe next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.\n\n23:18 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in\nthe wood, and Jonathan went to his house.\n\n23:19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not\nDavid hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of\nHachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?  23:20 Now therefore, O\nking, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down;\nand our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.\n\n23:21 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion\non me.\n\n23:22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where\nhis haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he\ndealeth very subtilly.\n\n23:23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places\nwhere he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty,\nand I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the\nland, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of\nJudah.\n\n23:24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his\nmen were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of\nJeshimon.\n\n23:25 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;\nwherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of\nMaon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the\nwilderness of Maon.\n\n23:26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his\nmen on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for\nfear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round\nabout to take them.\n\n23:27 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and\ncome; for the Philistines have invaded the land.\n\n23:28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went\nagainst the Philistines: therefore they called that place\nSelahammahlekoth.\n\n23:29 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at\nEngedi.\n\n24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the\nPhilistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the\nwilderness of Engedi.\n\n24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and\nwent to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.\n\n24:3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and\nSaul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the\nsides of the cave.\n\n24:4 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the\nLORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine\nhand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then\nDavid arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.\n\n24:5 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,\nbecause he had cut off Saul's skirt.\n\n24:6 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this\nthing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand\nagainst him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.\n\n24:7 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them\nnot to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went\non his way.\n\n24:8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried\nafter Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him,\nDavid stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.\n\n24:9 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,\nsaying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?  24:10 Behold, this day thine\neyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine\nhand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared\nthee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for\nhe is the LORD's anointed.\n\n24:11 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my\nhand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee\nnot, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in\nmine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my\nsoul to take it.\n\n24:12 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of\nthee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.\n\n24:13 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from\nthe wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.\n\n24:14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou\npursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.\n\n24:15 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and\nsee, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.\n\n24:16 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking\nthese words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son\nDavid? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\n\n24:17 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou\nhast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.\n\n24:18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with\nme: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou\nkilledst me not.\n\n24:19 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?\nwherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me\nthis day.\n\n24:20 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and\nthat the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.\n\n24:21 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut\noff my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my\nfather's house.\n\n24:22 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his\nmen gat them up unto the hold.\n\n25:1 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,\nand lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David\narose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.\n\n25:2 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;\nand the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a\nthousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.\n\n25:3 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife\nAbigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful\ncountenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he\nwas of the house of Caleb.\n\n25:4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.\n\n25:5 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young\nmen, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:\n25:6 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be\nboth to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that\nthou hast.\n\n25:7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds\nwhich were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing\nunto them, all the while they were in Carmel.\n\n25:8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the\nyoung men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give,\nI pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to\nthy son David.\n\n25:9 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to\nall those words in the name of David, and ceased.\n\n25:10 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and\nwho is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break\naway every man from his master.\n\n25:11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I\nhave killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not\nwhence they be?  25:12 So David's young men turned their way, and went\nagain, and came and told him all those sayings.\n\n25:13 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And\nthey girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his\nsword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two\nhundred abode by the stuff.\n\n25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,\nBehold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our\nmaster; and he railed on them.\n\n25:15 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,\nneither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them,\nwhen we were in the fields: 25:16 They were a wall unto us both by\nnight and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.\n\n25:17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is\ndetermined against our master, and against all his household: for he\nis such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.\n\n25:18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two\nbottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of\nparched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred\ncakes of figs, and laid them on asses.\n\n25:19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come\nafter you. But she told not her husband Nabal.\n\n25:20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the\ncovert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against\nher; and she met them.\n\n25:21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this\nfellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that\npertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.\n\n25:22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of\nall that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against\nthe wall.\n\n25:23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,\nand fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,\n25:24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let\nthis iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine\naudience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.\n\n25:25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even\nNabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is\nwith him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom\nthou didst send.\n\n25:26 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul\nliveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed\nblood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine\nenemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.\n\n25:27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my\nlord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.\n\n25:28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the\nLORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord\nfighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee\nall thy days.\n\n25:29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the\nsoul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy\nGod; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out\nof the middle of a sling.\n\n25:30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my\nlord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee,\nand shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel; 25:31 That this shall\nbe no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that\nthou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself:\nbut when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember\nthine handmaid.\n\n25:32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,\nwhich sent thee this day to meet me: 25:33 And blessed be thy advice,\nand blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed\nblood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.\n\n25:34 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath\nkept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to\nmeet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning\nlight any that pisseth against the wall.\n\n25:35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,\nand said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have\nhearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.\n\n25:36 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his\nhouse, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within\nhim, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or\nmore, until the morning light.\n\n25:37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out\nof Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died\nwithin him, and he became as a stone.\n\n25:38 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote\nNabal, that he died.\n\n25:39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be\nthe LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of\nNabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned\nthe wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed\nwith Abigail, to take her to him to wife.\n\n25:40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,\nthey spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to\nhim to wife.\n\n25:41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and\nsaid, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the\nservants of my lord.\n\n25:42 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five\ndamsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers\nof David, and became his wife.\n\n25:43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of\nthem his wives.\n\n25:44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti\nthe son of Laish, which was of Gallim.\n\n26:1 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David\nhide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?  26:2\nThen Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three\nthousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the\nwilderness of Ziph.\n\n26:3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before\nJeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw\nthat Saul came after him into the wilderness.\n\n26:4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come\nin very deed.\n\n26:5 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:\nand David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,\nthe captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people\npitched round about him.\n\n26:6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to\nAbishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down\nwith me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with\nthee.\n\n26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,\nSaul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground\nat his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.\n\n26:8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into\nthine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with\nthe spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the\nsecond time.\n\n26:9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch\nforth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?  26:10\nDavid said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him;\nor his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and\nperish.\n\n26:11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against\nthe LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is\nat his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.\n\n26:12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's\nbolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,\nneither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from\nthe LORD was fallen upon them.\n\n26:13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of\nan hill afar off; a great space being between them: 26:14 And David\ncried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest\nthou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that\ncriest to the king?  26:15 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a\nvaliant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast\nthou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in\nto destroy the king thy lord.\n\n26:16 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,\nye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's\nanointed.\n\nAnd now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was\nat his bolster.\n\n26:17 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son\nDavid? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.\n\n26:18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his\nservant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?  26:19\nNow therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his\nservant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept\nan offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before\nthe LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the\ninheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.\n\n26:20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the\nface of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea,\nas when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.\n\n26:21 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will\nno more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this\nday: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.\n\n26:22 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let\none of the young men come over and fetch it.\n\n26:23 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his\nfaithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I\nwould not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.\n\n26:24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,\nso let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him\ndeliver me out of all tribulation.\n\n26:25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou\nshalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David\nwent on his way, and Saul returned to his place.\n\n27:1 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the\nhand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should\nspeedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall\ndespair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I\nescape out of his hand.\n\n27:2 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that\nwere with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.\n\n27:3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man\nwith his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the\nJezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.\n\n27:4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought\nno more again for him.\n\n27:5 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine\neyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may\ndwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with\nthee?  27:6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag\npertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.\n\n27:7 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines\nwas a full year and four months.\n\n27:8 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and\nthe Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the\ninhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of\nEgypt.\n\n27:9 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,\nand took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels,\nand the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.\n\n27:10 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David\nsaid, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the\nJerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.\n\n27:11 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to\nGath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and\nso will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the\nPhilistines.\n\n27:12 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people\nIsrael utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for\never.\n\n28:1 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered\ntheir armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish\nsaid unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me\nto battle, thou and thy men.\n\n28:2 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant\ncan do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of\nmine head for ever.\n\n28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried\nhim in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that\nhad familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.\n\n28:4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and\npitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they\npitched in Gilboa.\n\n28:5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and\nhis heart greatly trembled.\n\n28:6 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,\nneither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\n\n28:7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a\nfamiliar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his\nservants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar\nspirit at Endor.\n\n28:8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he\nwent, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and\nhe said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring\nme him up, whom I shall name unto thee.\n\n28:9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath\ndone, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the\nwizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my\nlife, to cause me to die?  28:10 And Saul sware to her by the LORD,\nsaying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee\nfor this thing.\n\n28:11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he\nsaid, Bring me up Samuel.\n\n28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and\nthe woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou\nart Saul.\n\n28:13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?\nAnd the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.\n\n28:14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old\nman cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived\nthat it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and\nbowed himself.\n\n28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring\nme up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines\nmake war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no\nmore, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called\nthee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.\n\n28:16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the\nLORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?  28:17 And the\nLORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the\nkingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to\nDavid: 28:18 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor\nexecutedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done\nthis thing unto thee this day.\n\n28:19 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the\nhand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with\nme: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of\nthe Philistines.\n\n28:20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore\nafraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in\nhim; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.\n\n28:21 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,\nand said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I\nhave put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which\nthou spakest unto me.\n\n28:22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of\nthine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat,\nthat thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.\n\n28:23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,\ntogether with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their\nvoice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.\n\n28:24 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and\nkilled it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened\nbread thereof: 28:25 And she brought it before Saul, and before his\nservants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that\nnight.\n\n29:1 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:\nand the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.\n\n29:2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by\nthousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with\nAchish.\n\n29:3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews\nhere?  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not\nthis David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been\nwith me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him\nsince he fell unto me unto this day?  29:4 And the princes of the\nPhilistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines\nsaid unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his\nplace which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us\nto battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith\nshould he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the\nheads of these men?  29:5 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to\nanother in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten\nthousands?  29:6 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely,\nas the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy\ncoming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not\nfound evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day:\nnevertheless the lords favour thee not.\n\n29:7 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not\nthe lords of the Philistines.\n\n29:8 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast\nthou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this\nday, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\n29:9 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good\nin my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the\nPhilistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.\n\n29:10 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's\nservants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the\nmorning, and have light, depart.\n\n29:11 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to\nreturn into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up\nto Jezreel.\n\n30:1 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag\non the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and\nZiklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 30:2 And had\ntaken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either\ngreat or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.\n\n30:3 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned\nwith fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were\ntaken captives.\n\n30:4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their\nvoice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.\n\n30:5 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the\nJezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.\n\n30:6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning\nhim, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his\nsons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD\nhis God.\n\n30:7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray\nthee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the\nephod to David.\n\n30:8 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this\ntroop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou\nshalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.\n\n30:9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and\ncame to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.\n\n30:10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred\nabode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the\nbrook Besor.\n\n30:11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to\nDavid, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink\nwater; 30:12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two\nclusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to\nhim: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and\nthree nights.\n\n30:13 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art\nthou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;\nand my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.\n\n30:14 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon\nthe coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and\nwe burned Ziklag with fire.\n\n30:15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?\nAnd he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor\ndeliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to\nthis company.\n\n30:16 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread\nabroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because\nof all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the\nPhilistines, and out of the land of Judah.\n\n30:17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of\nthe next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred\nyoung men, which rode upon camels, and fled.\n\n30:18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:\nand David rescued his two wives.\n\n30:19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,\nneither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had\ntaken to them: David recovered all.\n\n30:20 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave\nbefore those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.\n\n30:21 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that\nthey could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the\nbrook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people\nthat were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted\nthem.\n\n30:22 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those\nthat went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will\nnot give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every\nman his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and\ndepart.\n\n30:23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that\nwhich the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the\ncompany that came against us into our hand.\n\n30:24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is\nthat goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by\nthe stuff: they shall part alike.\n\n30:25 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute\nand an ordinance for Israel unto this day.\n\n30:26 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the\nelders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you\nof the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 30:27 To them which were in\nBethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were\nin Jattir, 30:28 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which\nwere in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, 30:29 And to\nthem which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the\nJerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,\n30:30 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in\nChorashan, and to them which were in Athach, 30:31 And to them which\nwere in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men\nwere wont to haunt.\n\n31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel\nfled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.\n\n31:2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;\nand the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua,\nSaul's sons.\n\n31:3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;\nand he was sore wounded of the archers.\n\n31:4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust\nme through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me\nthrough, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore\nafraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.\n\n31:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell\nlikewise upon his sword, and died with him.\n\n31:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all\nhis men, that same day together.\n\n31:7 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the\nvalley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men\nof Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the\ncities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.\n\n31:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to\nstrip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in\nmount Gilboa.\n\n31:9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent\ninto the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the\nhouse of their idols, and among the people.\n\n31:10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they\nfastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.\n\n31:11 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the\nPhilistines had done to Saul; 31:12 All the valiant men arose, and\nwent all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons\nfrom the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.\n\n31:13 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at\nJabesh, and fasted seven days.\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Book of Samuel\n\nOtherwise Called:\n\nThe Second Book of the Kings\n\n\n1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was\nreturned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two\ndays in Ziklag; 1:2 It came even to pass on the third day, that,\nbehold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent,\nand earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he\nfell to the earth, and did obeisance.\n\n1:3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto\nhim, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.\n\n1:4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell\nme.\n\nAnd he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of\nthe people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are\ndead also.\n\n1:5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou\nthat Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  1:6 And the young man that\ntold him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul\nleaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed\nhard after him.\n\n1:7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And\nI answered, Here am I.\n\n1:8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an\nAmalekite.\n\n1:9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:\nfor anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.\n\n1:10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he\ncould not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was\nupon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought\nthem hither unto my lord.\n\n1:11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise\nall the men that were with him: 1:12 And they mourned, and wept, and\nfasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the\npeople of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were\nfallen by the sword.\n\n1:13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?\nAnd he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.\n\n1:14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch\nforth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?  1:15 And David\ncalled one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And\nhe smote him that he died.\n\n1:16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy\nmouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's\nanointed.\n\n1:17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over\nJonathan his son: 1:18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah\nthe use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)\n1:19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the\nmighty fallen!  1:20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the\nstreets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,\nlest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\n\n1:21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be\nrain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the\nmighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not\nbeen anointed with oil.\n\n1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow\nof Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.\n\n1:23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in\ntheir death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they\nwere stronger than lions.\n\n1:24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in\nscarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your\napparel.\n\n1:25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,\nthou wast slain in thine high places.\n\n1:26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast\nthou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of\nwomen.\n\n1:27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  2:1\nAnd it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD,\nsaying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD\nsaid unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he\nsaid, Unto Hebron.\n\n2:2 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the\nJezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.\n\n2:3 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with\nhis household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.\n\n2:4 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over\nthe house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of\nJabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.\n\n2:5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said\nunto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this\nkindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.\n\n2:6 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will\nrequite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.\n\n2:7 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant:\nfor your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have\nanointed me king over them.\n\n2:8 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth\nthe son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 2:9 And made him\nking over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over\nEphraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.\n\n2:10 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign\nover Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed\nDavid.\n\n2:11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of\nJudah was seven years and six months.\n\n2:12 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son\nof Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.\n\n2:13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,\nand met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on\nthe one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.\n\n2:14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play\nbefore us. And Joab said, Let them arise.\n\n2:15 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,\nwhich pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the\nservants of David.\n\n2:16 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his\nsword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that\nplace was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.\n\n2:17 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,\nand the men of Israel, before the servants of David.\n\n2:18 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,\nand Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.\n\n2:19 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the\nright hand nor to the left from following Abner.\n\n2:20 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he\nanswered, I am.\n\n2:21 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to\nthy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his\narmour.\n\nBut Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.\n\n2:22 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following\nme: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I\nhold up my face to Joab thy brother?  2:23 Howbeit he refused to turn\naside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him\nunder the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell\ndown there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as\nmany as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.\n\n2:24 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down\nwhen they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by\nthe way of the wilderness of Gibeon.\n\n2:25 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after\nAbner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.\n\n2:26 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for\never?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?\nhow long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from\nfollowing their brethren?  2:27 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless\nthou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up\nevery one from following his brother.\n\n2:28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and\npursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.\n\n2:29 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,\nand passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to\nMahanaim.\n\n2:30 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered\nall the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men\nand Asahel.\n\n2:31 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's\nmen, so that three hundred and threescore men died.\n\n2:32 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his\nfather, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night,\nand they came to Hebron at break of day.\n\n3:1 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of\nDavid: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul\nwaxed weaker and weaker.\n\n3:2 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was\nAmnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 3:3 And his second, Chileab, of\nAbigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the\nson of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 3:4 And the\nfourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son\nof Abital; 3:5 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These\nwere born to David in Hebron.\n\n3:6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul\nand the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house\nof Saul.\n\n3:7 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of\nAiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto\nmy father's concubine?  3:8 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of\nIshbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew\nkindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,\nand to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of\nDavid, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this\nwoman?  3:9 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD\nhath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 3:10 To translate the\nkingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over\nIsrael and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.\n\n3:11 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared\nhim.\n\n3:12 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose\nis the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my\nhand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.\n\n3:13 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing\nI require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou\nfirst bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.\n\n3:14 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,\nDeliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred\nforeskins of the Philistines.\n\n3:15 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from\nPhaltiel the son of Laish.\n\n3:16 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to\nBahurim.\n\nThen said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.\n\n3:17 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye\nsought for David in times past to be king over you: 3:18 Now then do\nit: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my\nservant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the\nPhilistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.\n\n3:19 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also\nto speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to\nIsrael, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.\n\n3:20 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And\nDavid made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.\n\n3:21 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather\nall Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with\nthee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.\nAnd David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.\n\n3:22 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a\ntroop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with\nDavid in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.\n\n3:23 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told\nJoab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent\nhim away, and he is gone in peace.\n\n3:24 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?\nbehold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away,\nand he is quite gone?  3:25 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he\ncame to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and\nto know all that thou doest.\n\n3:26 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after\nAbner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew\nit not.\n\n3:27 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the\ngate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth\nrib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.\n\n3:28 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are\nguiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of\nNer: 3:29 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's\nhouse; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an\nissue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth\non the sword, or that lacketh bread.\n\n3:30 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain\ntheir brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.\n\n3:31 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,\nRend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before\nAbner. And king David himself followed the bier.\n\n3:32 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his\nvoice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.\n\n3:33 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool\ndieth?  3:34 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:\nas a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the\npeople wept again over him.\n\n3:35 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it\nwas yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I\ntaste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.\n\n3:36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as\nwhatsoever the king did pleased all the people.\n\n3:37 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was\nnot of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.\n\n3:38 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a\nprince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?  3:39 And I am this\nday weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be\ntoo hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to\nhis wickedness.\n\n4:1 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands\nwere feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.\n\n4:2 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name\nof the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of\nRimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also\nwas reckoned to Benjamin.\n\n4:3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there\nuntil this day.)  4:4 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was\nlame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul\nand Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and\nit came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became\nlame. And his name was Mephibosheth.\n\n4:5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,\nand came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay\non a bed at noon.\n\n4:6 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they\nwould have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and\nRechab and Baanah his brother escaped.\n\n4:7 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his\nbedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and\ntook his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.\n\n4:8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and\nsaid to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine\nenemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the\nking this day of Saul, and of his seed.\n\n4:9 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of\nRimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who\nhath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 4:10 When one told me,\nsaying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I\ntook hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would\nhave given him a reward for his tidings: 4:11 How much more, when\nwicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his\nbed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and\ntake you away from the earth?  4:12 And David commanded his young men,\nand they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged\nthem up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth,\nand buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.\n\n5:1 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and\nspake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.\n\n5:2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that\nleddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou\nshalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.\n\n5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king\nDavid made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they\nanointed David king over Israel.\n\n5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\nforty years.\n\n5:5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in\nJerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.\n\n5:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the\ninhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou\ntake away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither:\nthinking, David cannot come in hither.\n\n5:7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the\ncity of David.\n\n5:8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,\nand smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated\nof David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said,\nThe blind and the lame shall not come into the house.\n\n5:9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And\nDavid built round about from Millo and inward.\n\n5:10 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was\nwith him.\n\n5:11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,\nand carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.\n\n5:12 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over\nIsrael, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's\nsake.\n\n5:13 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,\nafter he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters\nborn to David.\n\n5:14 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in\nJerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 5:15 Ibhar\nalso, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 5:16 And Elishama, and\nEliada, and Eliphalet.\n\n5:17 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king\nover Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David\nheard of it, and went down to the hold.\n\n5:18 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of\nRephaim.\n\n5:19 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the\nPhilistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said\nunto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into\nthine hand.\n\n5:20 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and\nsaid, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the\nbreach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place\nBaalperazim.\n\n5:21 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned\nthem.\n\n5:22 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in\nthe valley of Rephaim.\n\n5:23 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go\nup; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against\nthe mulberry trees.\n\n5:24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops\nof the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then\nshall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the\nPhilistines.\n\n5:25 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the\nPhilistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.\n\n6:1 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,\nthirty thousand.\n\n6:2 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him\nfrom Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose\nname is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between\nthe cherubims.\n\n6:3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of\nthe house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons\nof Abinadab, drave the new cart.\n\n6:4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at\nGibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.\n\n6:5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on\nall manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on\npsalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.\n\n6:6 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his\nhand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.\n\n6:7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote\nhim there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.\n\n6:8 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon\nUzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.\n\n6:9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the\nark of the LORD come to me?  6:10 So David would not remove the ark of\nthe LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside\ninto the house of Obededom the Gittite.\n\n6:11 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the\nGittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his\nhousehold.\n\n6:12 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the\nhouse of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the\nark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house\nof Obededom into the city of David with gladness.\n\n6:13 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had\ngone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.\n\n6:14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David\nwas girded with a linen ephod.\n\n6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the\nLORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.\n\n6:16 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal\nSaul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping\nand dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.\n\n6:17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,\nin the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and\nDavid offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.\n\n6:18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings\nand peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of\nhosts.\n\n6:19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude\nof Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread,\nand a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people\ndeparted every one to his house.\n\n6:20 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the\ndaughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was\nthe king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of\nthe handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly\nuncovereth himself!  6:21 And David said unto Michal, It was before\nthe LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house,\nto appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:\ntherefore will I play before the LORD.\n\n6:22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine\nown sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them\nshall I be had in honour.\n\n6:23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day\nof her death.\n\n7:1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD\nhad given him rest round about from all his enemies; 7:2 That the king\nsaid unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar,\nbut the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.\n\n7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;\nfor the LORD is with thee.\n\n7:4 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came\nunto Nathan, saying, 7:5 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the\nLORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?  7:6 Whereas I\nhave not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the\nchildren of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in\na tent and in a tabernacle.\n\n7:7 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of\nIsrael spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I\ncommanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an\nhouse of cedar?  7:8 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant\nDavid, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote,\nfrom following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: 7:9\nAnd I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all\nthine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like\nunto the name of the great men that are in the earth.\n\n7:10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will\nplant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no\nmore; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,\nas beforetime, 7:11 And as since the time that I commanded judges to\nbe over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine\nenemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n\n7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy\nfathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of\nthy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n\n7:13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the\nthrone of his kingdom for ever.\n\n7:14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit\niniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes\nof the children of men: 7:15 But my mercy shall not depart away from\nhim, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.\n\n7:16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever\nbefore thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.\n\n7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,\nso did Nathan speak unto David.\n\n7:18 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,\nWho am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me\nhitherto?  7:19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord\nGOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great\nwhile to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?  7:20 And\nwhat can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy\nservant.\n\n7:21 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou\ndone all these great things, to make thy servant know them.\n\n7:22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like\nthee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we\nhave heard with our ears.\n\n7:23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like\nIsrael, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make\nhim a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land,\nbefore thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the\nnations and their gods?  7:24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy\npeople Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art\nbecome their God.\n\n7:25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning\nthy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do\nas thou hast said.\n\n7:26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts\nis the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be\nestablished before thee.\n\n7:27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy\nservant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy\nservant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.\n\n7:28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,\nand thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 7:29 Therefore\nnow let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may\ncontinue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it:\nand with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for\never.\n\n8:1 And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines,\nand subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the\nPhilistines.\n\n8:2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them\ndown to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death,\nand with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became\nDavid's servants, and brought gifts.\n\n8:3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he\nwent to recover his border at the river Euphrates.\n\n8:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred\nhorsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the\nchariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.\n\n8:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of\nZobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\n\n8:6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians\nbecame servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved\nDavid whithersoever he went.\n\n8:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of\nHadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\n\n8:8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David\ntook exceeding much brass.\n\n8:9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host\nof Hadadezer, 8:10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to\nsalute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer,\nand smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought\nwith him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:\n8:11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver\nand gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; 8:12\nOf Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the\nPhilistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of\nRehob, king of Zobah.\n\n8:13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the\nSyrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.\n\n8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he\ngarrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD\npreserved David whithersoever he went.\n\n8:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment\nand justice unto all his people.\n\n8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat\nthe son of Ahilud was recorder; 8:17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and\nAhimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the\nscribe; 8:18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the\nCherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.\n\n9:1 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of\nSaul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?  9:2 And there\nwas of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they\nhad called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And\nhe said, Thy servant is he.\n\n9:3 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that\nI may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king,\nJonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.\n\n9:4 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the\nking, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in\nLodebar.\n\n9:5 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,\nthe son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.\n\n9:6 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was\ncome unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David\nsaid, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!  9:7 And\nDavid said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness\nfor Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of\nSaul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.\n\n9:8 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou\nshouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?  9:9 Then the king called\nto Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy\nmaster's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.\n\n9:10 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the\nland for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's\nson may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat\nbread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty\nservants.\n\n9:11 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the\nking hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for\nMephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the\nking's sons.\n\n9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all\nthat dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.\n\n9:13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at\nthe king's table; and was lame on both his feet.\n\n10:1 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of\nAmmon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.\n\n10:2 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of\nNahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to\ncomfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's\nservants came into the land of the children of Ammon.\n\n10:3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their\nlord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath\nsent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants\nunto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?\n10:4 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one\nhalf of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even\nto their buttocks, and sent them away.\n\n10:5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the\nmen were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until\nyour beards be grown, and then return.\n\n10:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,\nthe children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the\nSyrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a\nthousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.\n\n10:7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the\nmighty men.\n\n10:8 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array\nat the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob,\nand Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.\n\n10:9 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before\nand behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in\narray against the Syrians: 10:10 And the rest of the people he\ndelivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them\nin array against the children of Ammon.\n\n10:11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou\nshalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee,\nthen I will come and help thee.\n\n10:12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and\nfor the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him\ngood.\n\n10:13 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the\nbattle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.\n\n10:14 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,\nthen fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab\nreturned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.\n\n10:15 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,\nthey gathered themselves together.\n\n10:16 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond\nthe river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host\nof Hadarezer went before them.\n\n10:17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and\npassed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves\nin array against David, and fought with him.\n\n10:18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of\nseven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen,\nand smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.\n\n10:19 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that\nthey were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and\nserved them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any\nmore.\n\n11:1 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when\nkings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with\nhim, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and\nbesieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.\n\n11:2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off\nhis bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the\nroof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful\nto look upon.\n\n11:3 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not\nthis Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?\n11:4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto\nhim, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness:\nand she returned unto her house.\n\n11:5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am\nwith child.\n\n11:6 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And\nJoab sent Uriah to David.\n\n11:7 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab\ndid, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.\n\n11:8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.\nAnd Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a\nmess of meat from the king.\n\n11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the\nservants of his lord, and went not down to his house.\n\n11:10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto\nhis house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?\nwhy then didst thou not go down unto thine house?  11:11 And Uriah\nsaid unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and\nmy lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open\nfields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to\nlie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not\ndo this thing.\n\n11:12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I\nwill let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the\nmorrow.\n\n11:13 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;\nand he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with\nthe servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.\n\n11:14 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to\nJoab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.\n\n11:15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the\nforefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may\nbe smitten, and die.\n\n11:16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he\nassigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.\n\n11:17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and\nthere fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the\nHittite died also.\n\n11:18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;\n11:19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of\ntelling the matters of the war unto the king, 11:20 And if so be that\nthe king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye\nso nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would\nshoot from the wall?  11:21 Who smote Abimelech the son of\nJerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him\nfrom the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then\nsay thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\n\n11:22 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab\nhad sent him for.\n\n11:23 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed\nagainst us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them\neven unto the entering of the gate.\n\n11:24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and\nsome of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite\nis dead also.\n\n11:25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto\nJoab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one\nas well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and\noverthrow it: and encourage thou him.\n\n11:26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was\ndead, she mourned for her husband.\n\n11:27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to\nhis house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing\nthat David had done displeased the LORD.\n\n12:1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and\nsaid unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the\nother poor.\n\n12:2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 12:3 But the\npoor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought\nand nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his\nchildren; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and\nlay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.\n\n12:4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to\ntake of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring\nman that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed\nit for the man that was come to him.\n\n12:5 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he\nsaid to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing\nshall surely die: 12:6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because\nhe did this thing, and because he had no pity.\n\n12:7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD\nGod of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee\nout of the hand of Saul; 12:8 And I gave thee thy master's house, and\nthy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel\nand of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have\ngiven unto thee such and such things.\n\n12:9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do\nevil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,\nand hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the\nsword of the children of Ammon.\n\n12:10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;\nbecause thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the\nHittite to be thy wife.\n\n12:11 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee\nout of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes,\nand give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in\nthe sight of this sun.\n\n12:12 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all\nIsrael, and before the sun.\n\n12:13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And\nNathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou\nshalt not die.\n\n12:14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to\nthe enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto\nthee shall surely die.\n\n12:15 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the\nchild that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.\n\n12:16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,\nand went in, and lay all night upon the earth.\n\n12:17 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him\nup from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with\nthem.\n\n12:18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And\nthe servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for\nthey said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him,\nand he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself,\nif we tell him that the child is dead?  12:19 But when David saw that\nhis servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead:\ntherefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they\nsaid, He is dead.\n\n12:20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed\nhimself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD,\nand worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required,\nthey set bread before him, and he did eat.\n\n12:21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou\nhast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;\nbut when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.\n\n12:22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:\nfor I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the\nchild may live?  12:23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?\ncan I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return\nto me.\n\n12:24 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,\nand lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon:\nand the LORD loved him.\n\n12:25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his\nname Jedidiah, because of the LORD.\n\n12:26 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and\ntook the royal city.\n\n12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought\nagainst Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.\n\n12:28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp\nagainst the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called\nafter my name.\n\n12:29 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,\nand fought against it, and took it.\n\n12:30 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight\nwhereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set\non David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great\nabundance.\n\n12:31 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them\nunder saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and\nmade them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the\ncities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned\nunto Jerusalem.\n\n13:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had\na fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved\nher.\n\n13:2 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;\nfor she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything\nto her.\n\n13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of\nShimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.\n\n13:4 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean\nfrom day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I\nlove Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\n\n13:5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make\nthyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I\npray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the\nmeat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.\n\n13:6 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was\ncome to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my\nsister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat\nat her hand.\n\n13:7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother\nAmnon's house, and dress him meat.\n\n13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.\nAnd she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and\ndid bake the cakes.\n\n13:9 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he\nrefused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they\nwent out every man from him.\n\n13:10 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that\nI may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made,\nand brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.\n\n13:11 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of\nher, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.\n\n13:12 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no\nsuch thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.\n\n13:13 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,\nthou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray\nthee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.\n\n13:14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger\nthan she, forced her, and lay with her.\n\n13:15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith\nhe hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And\nAmnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.\n\n13:16 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending\nme away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he\nwould not hearken unto her.\n\n13:17 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,\nPut now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.\n\n13:18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such\nrobes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his\nservant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.\n\n13:19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers\ncolours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on\ncrying.\n\n13:20 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother\nbeen with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother;\nregard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother\nAbsalom's house.\n\n13:21 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very\nwroth.\n\n13:22 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:\nfor Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.\n\n13:23 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had\nsheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom\ninvited all the king's sons.\n\n13:24 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant\nhath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go\nwith thy servant.\n\n13:25 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now\ngo, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he\nwould not go, but blessed him.\n\n13:26 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go\nwith us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?\n13:27 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's\nsons go with him.\n\n13:28 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when\nAmnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite\nAmnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be\ncourageous, and be valiant.\n\n13:29 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had\ncommanded.\n\nThen all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his\nmule, and fled.\n\n13:30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings\ncame to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and\nthere is not one of them left.\n\n13:31 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the\nearth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.\n\n13:32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and\nsaid, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men\nthe king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of\nAbsalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his\nsister Tamar.\n\n13:33 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his\nheart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is\ndead.\n\n13:34 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted\nup his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the\nway of the hill side behind him.\n\n13:35 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as\nthy servant said, so it is.\n\n13:36 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,\nthat, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and\nwept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.\n\n13:37 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king\nof Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.\n\n13:38 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.\n\n13:39 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for\nhe was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.\n\n14:1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was\ntoward Absalom.\n\n14:2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and\nsaid unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on\nnow mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a\nwoman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 14:3 And come to the\nking, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her\nmouth.\n\n14:4 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her\nface to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.\n\n14:5 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I\nam indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.\n\n14:6 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in\nthe field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the\nother, and slew him.\n\n14:7 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,\nand they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill\nhim, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the\nheir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall\nnot leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.\n\n14:8 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will\ngive charge concerning thee.\n\n14:9 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the\niniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his\nthrone be guiltless.\n\n14:10 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to\nme, and he shall not touch thee any more.\n\n14:11 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy\nGod, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy\nany more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth,\nthere shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.\n\n14:12 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one\nword unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.\n\n14:13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a\nthing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as\none which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his\nbanished.\n\n14:14 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,\nwhich cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any\nperson: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled\nfrom him.\n\n14:15 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord\nthe king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy\nhandmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king\nwill perform the request of his handmaid.\n\n14:16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand\nof the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the\ninheritance of God.\n\n14:17 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now\nbe comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to\ndiscern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.\n\n14:18 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from\nme, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said,\nLet my lord the king now speak.\n\n14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all\nthis?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord\nthe king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought\nthat my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me,\nand he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: 14:20 To\nfetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing:\nand my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to\nknow all things that are in the earth.\n\n14:21 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:\ngo therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.\n\n14:22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and\nthanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I\nhave found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath\nfulfilled the request of his servant.\n\n14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to\nJerusalem.\n\n14:24 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him\nnot see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the\nking's face.\n\n14:25 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as\nAbsalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of\nhis head there was no blemish in him.\n\n14:26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end\nthat he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he\npolled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels\nafter the king's weight.\n\n14:27 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,\nwhose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.\n\n14:28 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the\nking's face.\n\n14:29 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;\nbut he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time,\nhe would not come.\n\n14:30 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near\nmine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's\nservants set the field on fire.\n\n14:31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said\nunto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?  14:32 And\nAbsalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,\nthat I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from\nGeshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now\ntherefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in\nme, let him kill me.\n\n14:33 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called\nfor Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the\nground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.\n\n15:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him\nchariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\n\n15:2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:\nand it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the\nking for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what\ncity art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of\nIsrael.\n\n15:3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right;\nbut there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.\n\n15:4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,\nthat every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I\nwould do him justice!  15:5 And it was so, that when any man came nigh\nto him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and\nkissed him.\n\n15:6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the\nking for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\n\n15:7 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the\nking, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto\nthe LORD, in Hebron.\n\n15:8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,\nsaying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I\nwill serve the LORD.\n\n15:9 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to\nHebron.\n\n15:10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,\nsaying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall\nsay, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.\n\n15:11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that\nwere called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any\nthing.\n\n15:12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's\ncounsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered\nsacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased\ncontinually with Absalom.\n\n15:13 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the\nmen of Israel are after Absalom.\n\n15:14 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at\nJerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from\nAbsalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring\nevil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.\n\n15:15 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants\nare ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.\n\n15:16 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And\nthe king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.\n\n15:17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and\ntarried in a place that was far off.\n\n15:18 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the\nCherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred\nmen which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.\n\n15:19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou\nalso with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou\nart a stranger, and also an exile.\n\n15:20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee\ngo up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and\ntake back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.\n\n15:21 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and\nas my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king\nshall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant\nbe.\n\n15:22 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite\npassed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with\nhim.\n\n15:23 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people\npassed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and\nall the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.\n\n15:24 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing\nthe ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and\nAbiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the\ncity.\n\n15:25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the\ncity: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me\nagain, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 15:26 But if he thus\nsay, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as\nseemeth good unto him.\n\n15:27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?\nreturn into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy\nson, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.\n\n15:28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there\ncome word from you to certify me.\n\n15:29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to\nJerusalem: and they tarried there.\n\n15:30 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he\nwent up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the\npeople that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up,\nweeping as they went up.\n\n15:31 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators\nwith Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of\nAhithophel into foolishness.\n\n15:32 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the\nmount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to\nmeet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 15:33 Unto whom\nDavid said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden\nunto me: 15:34 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I\nwill be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant\nhitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me\ndefeat the counsel of Ahithophel.\n\n15:35 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the\npriests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt\nhear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar\nthe priests.\n\n15:36 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz\nZadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send\nunto me every thing that ye can hear.\n\n15:37 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came\ninto Jerusalem.\n\n16:1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,\nZiba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses\nsaddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred\nbunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of\nwine.\n\n16:2 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba\nsaid, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread\nand summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as\nbe faint in the wilderness may drink.\n\n16:3 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said\nunto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day\nshall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.\n\n16:4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained\nunto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may\nfind grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.\n\n16:5 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a\nman of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son\nof Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.\n\n16:6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king\nDavid: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right\nhand and on his left.\n\n16:7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou\nbloody man, and thou man of Belial: 16:8 The LORD hath returned upon\nthee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast\nreigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of\nAbsalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because\nthou art a bloody man.\n\n16:9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should\nthis dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and\ntake off his head.\n\n16:10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of\nZeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse\nDavid. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  16:11 And\nDavid said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which\ncame forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this\nBenjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath\nbidden him.\n\n16:12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that\nthe LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.\n\n16:13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on\nthe hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw\nstones at him, and cast dust.\n\n16:14 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary,\nand refreshed themselves there.\n\n16:15 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to\nJerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.\n\n16:16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,\nwas come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the\nking, God save the king.\n\n16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?\nwhy wentest thou not with thy friend?  16:18 And Hushai said unto\nAbsalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of\nIsrael, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.\n\n16:19 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the\npresence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so\nwill I be in thy presence.\n\n16:20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we\nshall do.\n\n16:21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's\nconcubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall\nhear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all\nthat are with thee be strong.\n\n16:22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and\nAbsalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all\nIsrael.\n\n16:23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those\ndays, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all\nthe counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.\n\n17:1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out\ntwelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this\nnight: 17:2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak\nhanded, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him\nshall flee; and I will smite the king only: 17:3 And I will bring back\nall the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all\nreturned: so all the people shall be in peace.\n\n17:4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of\nIsrael.\n\n17:5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us\nhear likewise what he saith.\n\n17:6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,\nsaying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after\nhis saying? if not; speak thou.\n\n17:7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath\ngiven is not good at this time.\n\n17:8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they\nbe mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of\nher whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not\nlodge with the people.\n\n17:9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it\nwill come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that\nwhosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people\nthat follow Absalom.\n\n17:10 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a\nlion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a\nmighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.\n\n17:11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto\nthee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for\nmultitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.\n\n17:12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,\nand we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of\nhim and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so\nmuch as one.\n\n17:13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel\nbring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until\nthere be not one small stone found there.\n\n17:14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of\nHushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the\nLORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the\nintent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.\n\n17:15 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus\nand thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and\nthus and thus have I counselled.\n\n17:16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not\nthis night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over;\nlest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.\n\n17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not\nbe seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and\nthey went and told king David.\n\n17:18 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went\nboth of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which\nhad a well in his court; whither they went down.\n\n17:19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth,\nand spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.\n\n17:20 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they\nsaid, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them,\nThey be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and\ncould not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.\n\n17:21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up\nout of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David,\nArise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel\ncounselled against you.\n\n17:22 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and\nthey passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of\nthem that was not gone over Jordan.\n\n17:23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he\nsaddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his\ncity, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died,\nand was buried in the sepulchre of his father.\n\n17:24 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he\nand all the men of Israel with him.\n\n17:25 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:\nwhich Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that\nwent in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's\nmother.\n\n17:26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.\n\n17:27 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi\nthe son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the\nson of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,\n17:28 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and\nbarley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and\nparched pulse, 17:29 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of\nkine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for\nthey said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the\nwilderness.\n\n18:1 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set\ncaptains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.\n\n18:2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of\nJoab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,\nJoab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.\nAnd the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you\nmyself also.\n\n18:3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee\naway, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they\ncare for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now\nit is better that thou succour us out of the city.\n\n18:4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And\nthe king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by\nhundreds and by thousands.\n\n18:5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal\ngently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the\npeople heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning\nAbsalom.\n\n18:6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the\nbattle was in the wood of Ephraim; 18:7 Where the people of Israel\nwere slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great\nslaughter that day of twenty thousand men.\n\n18:8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the\ncountry: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword\ndevoured.\n\n18:9 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a\nmule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his\nhead caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven\nand the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.\n\n18:10 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw\nAbsalom hanged in an oak.\n\n18:11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou\nsawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and\nI would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.\n\n18:12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand\nshekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand\nagainst the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and\nAbishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man\nAbsalom.\n\n18:13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:\nfor there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest\nhave set thyself against me.\n\n18:14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took\nthree darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,\nwhile he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.\n\n18:15 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and\nsmote Absalom, and slew him.\n\n18:16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing\nafter Israel: for Joab held back the people.\n\n18:17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the\nwood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel\nfled every one to his tent.\n\n18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself\na pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to\nkeep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own\nname: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.\n\n18:19 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the\nking tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.\n\n18:20 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,\nbut thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear\nno tidings, because the king's son is dead.\n\n18:21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.\nAnd Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.\n\n18:22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But\nhowsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said,\nWherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings\nready?  18:23 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto\nhim, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.\n\n18:24 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to\nthe roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and\nlooked, and behold a man running alone.\n\n18:25 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If\nhe be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and\ndrew near.\n\n18:26 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman\ncalled unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone.\nAnd the king said, He also bringeth tidings.\n\n18:27 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost\nis like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He\nis a good man, and cometh with good tidings.\n\n18:28 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he\nfell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said,\nBlessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that\nlifted up their hand against my lord the king.\n\n18:29 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz\nanswered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw\na great tumult, but I knew not what it was.\n\n18:30 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he\nturned aside, and stood still.\n\n18:31 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the\nking: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up\nagainst thee.\n\n18:32 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And\nCushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise\nagainst thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.\n\n18:33 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the\ngate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my\nson, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,\nmy son!  19:1 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and\nmourneth for Absalom.\n\n19:2 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the\npeople: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for\nhis son.\n\n19:3 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as\npeople being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.\n\n19:4 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud\nvoice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!  19:5 And Joab\ncame into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day\nthe faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and\nthe lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy\nwives, and the lives of thy concubines; 19:6 In that thou lovest thine\nenemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that\nthou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive,\nthat if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had\npleased thee well.\n\n19:7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy\nservants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will\nnot tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee\nthan all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.\n\n19:8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all\nthe people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the\npeople came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his\ntent.\n\n19:9 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of\nIsrael, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and\nhe delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled\nout of the land for Absalom.\n\n19:10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now\ntherefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?  19:11\nAnd king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,\nSpeak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring\nthe king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to\nthe king, even to his house.\n\n19:12 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then\nare ye the last to bring back the king?  19:13 And say ye to Amasa,\nArt thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more\nalso, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the\nroom of Joab.\n\n19:14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the\nheart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return\nthou, and all thy servants.\n\n19:15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to\nGilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.\n\n19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,\nhasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.\n\n19:17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the\nservant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty\nservants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.\n\n19:18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's\nhousehold, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera\nfell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 19:19 And said\nunto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do\nthou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my\nlord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to\nhis heart.\n\n19:20 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,\nI am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to\nmeet my lord the king.\n\n19:21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not\nShimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's\nanointed?  19:22 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons\nof Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall\nthere any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know\nthat I am this day king over Israel?  19:23 Therefore the king said\nunto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.\n\n19:24 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and\nhad neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his\nclothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in\npeace.\n\n19:25 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the\nking, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,\nMephibosheth?  19:26 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant\ndeceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may\nride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.\n\n19:27 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my\nlord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in\nthine eyes.\n\n19:28 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord\nthe king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at\nthine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto\nthe king?  19:29 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any\nmore of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.\n\n19:30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,\nforasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own\nhouse.\n\n19:31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went\nover Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.\n\n19:32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and\nhe had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for\nhe was a very great man.\n\n19:33 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I\nwill feed thee with me in Jerusalem.\n\n19:34 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that\nI should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?  19:35 I am this day\nfourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy\nservant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the\nvoice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy\nservant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?  19:36 Thy servant will\ngo a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king\nrecompense it me with such a reward?  19:37 Let thy servant, I pray\nthee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried\nby the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant\nChimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what\nshall seem good unto thee.\n\n19:38 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will\ndo to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou\nshalt require of me, that will I do for thee.\n\n19:39 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come\nover, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto\nhis own place.\n\n19:40 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:\nand all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the\npeople of Israel.\n\n19:41 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said\nunto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee\naway, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's\nmen with him, over Jordan?  19:42 And all the men of Judah answered\nthe men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore\nthen be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's\ncost? or hath he given us any gift?  19:43 And the men of Israel\nanswered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king,\nand we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise\nus, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?\nAnd the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the\nmen of Israel.\n\n20:1 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was\nSheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and\nsaid, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son\nof Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.\n\n20:2 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed\nSheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king,\nfrom Jordan even to Jerusalem.\n\n20:3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the\nten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put\nthem in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were\nshut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.\n\n20:4 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within\nthree days, and be thou here present.\n\n20:5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer\nthan the set time which he had appointed him.\n\n20:6 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do\nus more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and\npursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.\n\n20:7 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and\nthe Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of\nJerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n\n20:8 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went\nbefore them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto\nhim, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the\nsheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.\n\n20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab\ntook Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.\n\n20:10 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so\nhe smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to\nthe ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai\nhis brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n\n20:11 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth\nJoab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.\n\n20:12 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And\nwhen the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out\nof the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw\nthat every one that came by him stood still.\n\n20:13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on\nafter Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n\n20:14 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to\nBethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and\nwent also after him.\n\n20:15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they\ncast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all\nthe people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.\n\n20:16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray\nyou, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.\n\n20:17 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou\nJoab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the\nwords of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.\n\n20:18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,\nsaying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the\nmatter.\n\n20:19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou\nseekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou\nswallow up the inheritance of the LORD?  20:20 And Joab answered and\nsaid, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or\ndestroy.\n\n20:21 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son\nof Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even\nagainst David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And\nthe woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee\nover the wall.\n\n20:22 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they\ncut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.\nAnd he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to\nhis tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.\n\n20:23 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of\nJehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 20:24 And\nAdoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was\nrecorder: 20:25 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the\npriests: 20:26 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.\n\n21:1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year\nafter year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It\nis for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.\n\n21:2 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the\nGibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of\nthe Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul\nsought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)\n21:3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for\nyou?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the\ninheritance of the LORD?  21:4 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We\nwill have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us\nshalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say,\nthat will I do for you.\n\n21:5 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that\ndevised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any\nof the coasts of Israel, 21:6 Let seven men of his sons be delivered\nunto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul,\nwhom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.\n\n21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of\nSaul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David\nand Jonathan the son of Saul.\n\n21:8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,\nwhom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of\nMichal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of\nBarzillai the Meholathite: 21:9 And he delivered them into the hands\nof the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD:\nand they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of\nharvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.\n\n21:10 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it\nfor her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water\ndropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the\nair to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.\n\n21:11 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the\nconcubine of Saul, had done.\n\n21:12 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of\nJonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them\nfrom the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them,\nwhen the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 21:13 And he brought up\nfrom thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and\nthey gathered the bones of them that were hanged.\n\n21:14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the\ncountry of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and\nthey performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was\nintreated for the land.\n\n21:15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and\nDavid went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the\nPhilistines: and David waxed faint.\n\n21:16 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight\nof whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he\nbeing girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.\n\n21:17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the\nPhilistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him,\nsaying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench\nnot the light of Israel.\n\n21:18 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle\nwith the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph,\nwhich was of the sons of the giant.\n\n21:19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where\nElhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of\nGoliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's\nbeam.\n\n21:20 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great\nstature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six\ntoes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.\n\n21:21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the\nbrother of David slew him.\n\n21:22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand\nof David, and by the hand of his servants.\n\n22:1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day\nthat the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,\nand out of the hand of Saul: 22:2 And he said, The LORD is my rock,\nand my fortress, and my deliverer; 22:3 The God of my rock; in him\nwill I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high\ntower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.\n\n22:4 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I\nbe saved from mine enemies.\n\n22:5 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men\nmade me afraid; 22:6 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the\nsnares of death prevented me; 22:7 In my distress I called upon the\nLORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple,\nand my cry did enter into his ears.\n\n22:8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven\nmoved and shook, because he was wroth.\n\n22:9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his\nmouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.\n\n22:10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under\nhis feet.\n\n22:11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the\nwings of the wind.\n\n22:12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and\nthick clouds of the skies.\n\n22:13 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.\n\n22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his\nvoice.\n\n22:15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and\ndiscomfited them.\n\n22:16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the\nworld were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of\nthe breath of his nostrils.\n\n22:17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;\n22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated\nme: for they were too strong for me.\n\n22:19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my\nstay.\n\n22:20 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,\nbecause he delighted in me.\n\n22:21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to\nthe cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.\n\n22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly\ndeparted from my God.\n\n22:23 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I\ndid not depart from them.\n\n22:24 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine\niniquity.\n\n22:25 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my\nrighteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.\n\n22:26 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the\nupright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.\n\n22:27 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward\nthou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.\n\n22:28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon\nthe haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.\n\n22:29 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my\ndarkness.\n\n22:30 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped\nover a wall.\n\n22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:\nhe is a buckler to all them that trust in him.\n\n22:32 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?\n22:33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.\n\n22:34 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high\nplaces.\n\n22:35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by\nmine arms.\n\n22:36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy\ngentleness hath made me great.\n\n22:37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not\nslip.\n\n22:38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not\nagain until I had consumed them.\n\n22:39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not\narise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.\n\n22:40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose\nup against me hast thou subdued under me.\n\n22:41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might\ndestroy them that hate me.\n\n22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but\nhe answered them not.\n\n22:43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did\nstamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.\n\n22:44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,\nthou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not\nshall serve me.\n\n22:45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear,\nthey shall be obedient unto me.\n\n22:46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their\nclose places.\n\n22:47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God\nof the rock of my salvation.\n\n22:48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people\nunder me.\n\n22:49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast\nlifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast\ndelivered me from the violent man.\n\n22:50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the\nheathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.\n\n22:51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to\nhis anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.\n\n23:1 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse\nsaid, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God\nof Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, 23:2 The Spirit of\nthe LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.\n\n23:3 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that\nruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.\n\n23:4 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,\neven a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of\nthe earth by clear shining after rain.\n\n23:5 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an\neverlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all\nmy salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.\n\n23:6 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust\naway, because they cannot be taken with hands: 23:7 But the man that\nshall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;\nand they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.\n\n23:8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The\nTachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same\nwas Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom\nhe slew at one time.\n\n23:9 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the\nthree mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that\nwere there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were\ngone away: 23:10 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand\nwas weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a\ngreat victory that day; and the people returned after him only to\nspoil.\n\n23:11 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the\nPhilistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of\nground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.\n\n23:12 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and\nslew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.\n\n23:13 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in\nthe harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the\nPhilistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.\n\n23:14 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the\nPhilistines was then in Bethlehem.\n\n23:15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of\nthe water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!  23:16 And\nthe three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and\ndrew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and\ntook it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink\nthereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.\n\n23:17 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:\nis not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?\ntherefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty\nmen.\n\n23:18 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief\namong three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and\nslew them, and had the name among three.\n\n23:19 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their\ncaptain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.\n\n23:20 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of\nKabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he\nwent down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:\n23:21 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a\nspear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked\nthe spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.\n\n23:22 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name\namong three mighty men.\n\n23:23 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to\nthe first three. And David set him over his guard.\n\n23:24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the\nson of Dodo of Bethlehem, 23:25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the\nHarodite, 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,\n23:27 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 23:28 Zalmon\nthe Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 23:29 Heleb the son of Baanah,\na Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children\nof Benjamin, 23:30 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of\nGaash, 23:31 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 23:32\nEliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 23:33\nShammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 23:34\nEliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the\nson of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 23:35 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the\nArbite, 23:36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 23:37\nZelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the\nson of Zeruiah, 23:38 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite, 23:39 Uriah\nthe Hittite: thirty and seven in all.\n\n24:1 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and\nhe moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.\n\n24:2 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with\nhim, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to\nBeersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the\npeople.\n\n24:3 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the\npeople, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of\nmy lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in\nthis thing?  24:4 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against\nJoab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains\nof the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the\npeople of Israel.\n\n24:5 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right\nside of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and\ntoward Jazer: 24:6 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of\nTahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon, 24:7 And\ncame to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites,\nand of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even\nto Beersheba.\n\n24:8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to\nJerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.\n\n24:9 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the\nking: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that\ndrew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.\n\n24:10 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the\npeople.\n\nAnd David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have\ndone: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy\nservant; for I have done very foolishly.\n\n24:11 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came\nunto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, 24:12 Go and say unto\nDavid, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one\nof them, that I may do it unto thee.\n\n24:13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall\nseven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee\nthree months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that\nthere be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what\nanswer I shall return to him that sent me.\n\n24:14 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now\ninto the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not\nfall into the hand of man.\n\n24:15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even\nto the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to\nBeersheba seventy thousand men.\n\n24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to\ndestroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel\nthat destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the\nangel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.\n\n24:17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote\nthe people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but\nthese sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be\nagainst me, and against my father's house.\n\n24:18 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear\nan altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.\n\n24:19 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD\ncommanded.\n\n24:20 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on\ntoward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on\nhis face upon the ground.\n\n24:21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his\nservant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build\nan altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.\n\n24:22 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer\nup what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt\nsacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen\nfor wood.\n\n24:23 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And\nAraunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.\n\n24:24 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of\nthee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my\nGod of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the\nthreshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.\n\n24:25 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt\nofferings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land,\nand the plague was stayed from Israel.\n\n\n\n\nThe First Book of the Kings\n\nCommonly Called:\n\nThe Third Book of the Kings\n\n\n1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered\nhim with clothes, but he gat no heat.\n\n1:2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my\nlord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and\nlet her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the\nking may get heat.\n\n1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of\nIsrael, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.\n\n1:4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and\nministered to him: but the king knew her not.\n\n1:5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will\nbe king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to\nrun before him.\n\n1:6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why\nhast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother\nbare him after Absalom.\n\n1:7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar\nthe priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.\n\n1:8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan\nthe prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to\nDavid, were not with Adonijah.\n\n1:9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of\nZoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's\nsons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants: 1:10 But Nathan\nthe prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother,\nhe called not.\n\n1:11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,\nsaying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth\nreign, and David our lord knoweth it not?  1:12 Now therefore come,\nlet me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine\nown life, and the life of thy son Solomon.\n\n1:13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not\nthou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly\nSolomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?\nwhy then doth Adonijah reign?  1:14 Behold, while thou yet talkest\nthere with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy\nwords.\n\n1:15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the\nking was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the\nking.\n\n1:16 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the\nking said, What wouldest thou?  1:17 And she said unto him, My lord,\nthou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying,\nAssuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon\nmy throne.\n\n1:18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,\nthou knowest it not: 1:19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and\nsheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and\nAbiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy\nservant hath he not called.\n\n1:20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,\nthat thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord\nthe king after him.\n\n1:21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall\nsleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted\noffenders.\n\n1:22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet\nalso came in.\n\n1:23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And\nwhen he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king\nwith his face to the ground.\n\n1:24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall\nreign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  1:25 For he is gone\ndown this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in\nabundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of\nthe host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink\nbefore him, and say, God save king Adonijah.\n\n1:26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah\nthe son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.\n\n1:27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed\nit unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king\nafter him?  1:28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba.\nAnd she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.\n\n1:29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath\nredeemed my soul out of all distress, 1:30 Even as I sware unto thee\nby the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall\nreign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so\nwill I certainly do this day.\n\n1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did\nreverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.\n\n1:32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the\nprophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the\nking.\n\n1:33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your\nlord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring\nhim down to Gihon: 1:34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the\nprophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the\ntrumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.\n\n1:35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my\nthrone; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to\nbe ruler over Israel and over Judah.\n\n1:36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,\nAmen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.\n\n1:37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with\nSolomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king\nDavid.\n\n1:38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son\nof Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and\ncaused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to\nGihon.\n\n1:39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,\nand anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people\nsaid, God save king Solomon.\n\n1:40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with\npipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the\nsound of them.\n\n1:41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as\nthey had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the\ntrumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an\nuproar?  1:42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of\nAbiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for\nthou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.\n\n1:43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king\nDavid hath made Solomon king.\n\n1:44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the\nprophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the\nPelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:\n1:45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him\nking in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the\ncity rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.\n\n1:46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.\n\n1:47 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king\nDavid, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and\nmake his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself\nupon the bed.\n\n1:48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,\nwhich hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even\nseeing it.\n\n1:49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose\nup, and went every man his way.\n\n1:50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and\ncaught hold on the horns of the altar.\n\n1:51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king\nSolomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,\nsaying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his\nservant with the sword.\n\n1:52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there\nshall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be\nfound in him, he shall die.\n\n1:53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.\nAnd he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto\nhim, Go to thine house.\n\n2:1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged\nSolomon his son, saying, 2:2 I go the way of all the earth: be thou\nstrong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 2:3 And keep the charge of\nthe LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his\ncommandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written\nin the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest,\nand whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 2:4 That the LORD may continue\nhis word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take\nheed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and\nwith all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the\nthrone of Israel.\n\n2:5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,\nand what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner\nthe son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and\nshed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his\ngirdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his\nfeet.\n\n2:6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go\ndown to the grave in peace.\n\n2:7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and\nlet them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me\nwhen I fled because of Absalom thy brother.\n\n2:8 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a\nBenjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day\nwhen I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I\nsware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with\nthe sword.\n\n2:9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and\nknowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring\nthou down to the grave with blood.\n\n2:10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of\nDavid.\n\n2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:\nseven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned\nhe in Jerusalem.\n\n2:12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his\nkingdom was established greatly.\n\n2:13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of\nSolomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.\n\n2:14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,\nSay on.\n\n2:15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all\nIsrael set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom\nis turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the\nLORD.\n\n2:16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said\nunto him, Say on.\n\n2:17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he\nwill not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to\nwife.\n\n2:18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.\n\n2:19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for\nAdonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto\nher, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the\nking's mother; and she sat on his right hand.\n\n2:20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,\nsay me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I\nwill not say thee nay.\n\n2:21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy\nbrother to wife.\n\n2:22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost\nthou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom\nalso; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the\npriest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.\n\n2:23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and\nmore also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.\n\n2:24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and\nset me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an\nhouse, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.\n\n2:25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;\nand he fell upon him that he died.\n\n2:26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,\nunto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at\nthis time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD\nGod before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in\nall wherein my father was afflicted.\n\n2:27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;\nthat he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning\nthe house of Eli in Shiloh.\n\n2:28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,\nthough he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle\nof the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\n\n2:29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the\ntabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon\nsent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.\n\n2:30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto\nhim, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die\nhere. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,\nand thus he answered me.\n\n2:31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon\nhim, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood,\nwhich Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.\n\n2:32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell\nupon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the\nsword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of\nNer, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,\ncaptain of the host of Judah.\n\n2:33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and\nupon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed,\nand upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever\nfrom the LORD.\n\n2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and\nslew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.\n\n2:35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the\nhost: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.\n\n2:36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build\nthee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence\nany whither.\n\n2:37 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over\nthe brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely\ndie: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.\n\n2:38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the\nking hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem\nmany days.\n\n2:39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the\nservants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.\nAnd they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.\n\n2:40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish\nto seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from\nGath.\n\n2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to\nGath, and was come again.\n\n2:42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I\nnot make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,\nKnow for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any\nwhither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word\nthat I have heard is good.\n\n2:43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the\ncommandment that I have charged thee with?  2:44 The king said\nmoreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart\nis privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD\nshall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 2:45 And king Solomon\nshall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before\nthe LORD for ever.\n\n2:46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went\nout, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established\nin the hand of Solomon.\n\n3:1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took\nPharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he\nhad made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD,\nand the wall of Jerusalem round about.\n\n3:2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no\nhouse built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.\n\n3:3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his\nfather: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.\n\n3:4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the\ngreat high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon\nthat altar.\n\n3:5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and\nGod said, Ask what I shall give thee.\n\n3:6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my\nfather great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and\nin righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast\nkept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to\nsit on his throne, as it is this day.\n\n3:7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of\nDavid my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out\nor come in.\n\n3:8 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast\nchosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for\nmultitude.\n\n3:9 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy\npeople, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to\njudge this thy so great a people?  3:10 And the speech pleased the\nLORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.\n\n3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and\nhast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for\nthyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for\nthyself understanding to discern judgment; 3:12 Behold, I have done\naccording to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an\nunderstanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,\nneither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.\n\n3:13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both\nriches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings\nlike unto thee all thy days.\n\n3:14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my\ncommandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy\ndays.\n\n3:15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to\nJerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and\noffered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a\nfeast to all his servants.\n\n3:16 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and\nstood before him.\n\n3:17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one\nhouse; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.\n\n3:18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,\nthat this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no\nstranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.\n\n3:19 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid\nit.\n\n3:20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while\nthine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead\nchild in my bosom.\n\n3:21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it\nwas dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was\nnot my son, which I did bear.\n\n3:22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the\ndead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the\nliving is my son. Thus they spake before the king.\n\n3:23 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,\nand thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the\ndead, and my son is the living.\n\n3:24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword\nbefore the king.\n\n3:25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half\nto the one, and half to the other.\n\n3:26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,\nfor her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her\nthe living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it\nbe neither mine nor thine, but divide it.\n\n3:27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and\nin no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.\n\n3:28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;\nand they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in\nhim, to do judgment.\n\n4:1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.\n\n4:2 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok\nthe priest, 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes;\nJehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.\n\n4:4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and\nAbiathar were the priests: 4:5 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over\nthe officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and\nthe king's friend: 4:6 And Ahishar was over the household: and\nAdoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.\n\n4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided\nvictuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year\nmade provision.\n\n4:8 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 4:9\nThe son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and\nElonbethhanan: 4:10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained\nSochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 4:11 The son of Abinadab, in all\nthe region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:\n4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,\nand all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from\nBethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:\n4:13 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of\nJair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained\nthe region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with\nwalls and brasen bars: 4:14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:\n4:15 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of\nSolomon to wife: 4:16 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in\nAloth: 4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 4:18 Shimei\nthe son of Elah, in Benjamin: 4:19 Geber the son of Uri was in the\ncountry of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and\nof Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the\nland.\n\n4:20 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in\nmultitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.\n\n4:21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the\nland of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought\npresents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.\n\n4:22 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine\nflour, and threescore measures of meal, 4:23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty\noxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and\nroebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.\n\n4:24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,\nfrom Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:\nand he had peace on all sides round about him.\n\n4:25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and\nunder his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of\nSolomon.\n\n4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,\nand twelve thousand horsemen.\n\n4:27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all\nthat came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they\nlacked nothing.\n\n4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they\nunto the place where the officers were, every man according to his\ncharge.\n\n4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and\nlargeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.\n\n4:30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of\nthe east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.\n\n4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and\nHeman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in\nall nations round about.\n\n4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a\nthousand and five.\n\n4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon\neven unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of\nbeasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.\n\n4:34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from\nall kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.\n\n5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had\nheard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for\nHiram was ever a lover of David.\n\n5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 5:3 Thou knowest how that David\nmy father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God\nfor the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put\nthem under the soles of his feet.\n\n5:4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that\nthere is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.\n\n5:5 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD\nmy God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom\nI will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto\nmy name.\n\n5:6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of\nLebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee\nwill I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt\nappoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can\nskill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.\n\n5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that\nhe rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which\nhath given unto David a wise son over this great people.\n\n5:8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things\nwhich thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning\ntimber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.\n\n5:9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I\nwill convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt\nappoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt\nreceive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for\nmy household.\n\n5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all\nhis desire.\n\n5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food\nto his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon\nto Hiram year by year.\n\n5:12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there\nwas peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league\ntogether.\n\n5:13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy\nwas thirty thousand men.\n\n5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a\nmonth they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was\nover the levy.\n\n5:15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,\nand fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 5:16 Beside the chief\nof Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and\nthree hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.\n\n5:17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly\nstones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.\n\n5:18 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the\nstonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.\n\n6:1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after\nthe children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the\nfourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is\nthe second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.\n\n6:2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length\nthereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,\nand the height thereof thirty cubits.\n\n6:3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was\nthe length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten\ncubits was the breadth thereof before the house.\n\n6:4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.\n\n6:5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,\nagainst the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of\nthe oracle: and he made chambers round about: 6:6 The nethermost\nchamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad,\nand the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the\nhouse he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be\nfastened in the walls of the house.\n\n6:7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made\nready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer\nnor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in\nbuilding.\n\n6:8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the\nhouse: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,\nand out of the middle into the third.\n\n6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with\nbeams and boards of cedar.\n\n6:10 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits\nhigh: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.\n\n6:11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 6:12 Concerning\nthis house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my\nstatutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to\nwalk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake\nunto David thy father: 6:13 And I will dwell among the children of\nIsrael, and will not forsake my people Israel.\n\n6:14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.\n\n6:15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,\nboth the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he\ncovered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the\nhouse with planks of fir.\n\n6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the\nfloor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it\nwithin, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.\n\n6:17 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits\nlong.\n\n6:18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open\nflowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.\n\n6:19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the\nark of the covenant of the LORD.\n\n6:20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and\ntwenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and\nhe overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of\ncedar.\n\n6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made\na partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid\nit with gold.\n\n6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished\nall the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid\nwith gold.\n\n6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each\nten cubits high.\n\n6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits\nthe other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing\nunto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.\n\n6:25 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of\none measure and one size.\n\n6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the\nother cherub.\n\n6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they\nstretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the\none touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the\nother wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the\nhouse.\n\n6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.\n\n6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved\nfigures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and\nwithout.\n\n6:30 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and\nwithout.\n\n6:31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:\nthe lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.\n\n6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them\ncarvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid\nthem with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm\ntrees.\n\n6:33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a\nfourth part of the wall.\n\n6:34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one\ndoor were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.\n\n6:35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:\nand covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.\n\n6:36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and\na row of cedar beams.\n\n6:37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD\nlaid, in the month Zif: 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month\nBul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all\nthe parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he\nseven years in building it.\n\n7:1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he\nfinished all his house.\n\n7:2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length\nthereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,\nand the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,\nwith cedar beams upon the pillars.\n\n7:3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on\nforty five pillars, fifteen in a row.\n\n7:4 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light\nin three ranks.\n\n7:5 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and\nlight was against light in three ranks.\n\n7:6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty\ncubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was\nbefore them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before\nthem.\n\n7:7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the\nporch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the\nfloor to the other.\n\n7:8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,\nwhich was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's\ndaughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.\n\n7:9 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of\nhewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the\nfoundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great\ncourt.\n\n7:10 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,\nstones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.\n\n7:11 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,\nand cedars.\n\n7:12 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed\nstones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the\nhouse of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.\n\n7:13 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.\n\n7:14 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was\na man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and\nunderstanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to\nking Solomon, and wrought all his work.\n\n7:15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:\nand a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.\n\n7:16 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops\nof the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and\nthe height of the other chapiter was five cubits: 7:17 And nets of\nchecker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were\nupon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for\nthe other chapiter.\n\n7:18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one\nnetwork, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with\npomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.\n\n7:19 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of\nlily work in the porch, four cubits.\n\n7:20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also\nabove, over against the belly which was by the network: and the\npomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other\nchapiter.\n\n7:21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set\nup the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up\nthe left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.\n\n7:22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of\nthe pillars finished.\n\n7:23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the\nother: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a\nline of thirty cubits did compass it round about.\n\n7:24 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing\nit, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were\ncast in two rows, when it was cast.\n\n7:25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and\nthree looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and\nthree looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,\nand all their hinder parts were inward.\n\n7:26 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was\nwrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained\ntwo thousand baths.\n\n7:27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one\nbase, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height\nof it.\n\n7:28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,\nand the borders were between the ledges: 7:29 And on the borders that\nwere between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the\nledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were\ncertain additions made of thin work.\n\n7:30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and\nthe four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were\nundersetters molten, at the side of every addition.\n\n7:31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:\nbut the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit\nand an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their\nborders, foursquare, not round.\n\n7:32 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the\nwheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit\nand half a cubit.\n\n7:33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:\ntheir axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,\nwere all molten.\n\n7:34 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:\nand the undersetters were of the very base itself.\n\n7:35 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a\ncubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the\nborders thereof were of the same.\n\n7:36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders\nthereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the\nproportion of every one, and additions round about.\n\n7:37 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one\ncasting, one measure, and one size.\n\n7:38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty\nbaths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten\nbases one laver.\n\n7:39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on\nthe left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of\nthe house eastward over against the south.\n\n7:40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So\nHiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for\nthe house of the LORD: 7:41 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the\nchapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two\nnetworks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the\ntop of the pillars; 7:42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two\nnetworks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the\ntwo bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; 7:43 And the\nten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 7:44 And one sea, and twelve\noxen under the sea; 7:45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the\nbasons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for\nthe house of the LORD, were of bright brass.\n\n7:46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground\nbetween Succoth and Zarthan.\n\n7:47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were\nexceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.\n\n7:48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of\nthe LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the\nshewbread was, 7:49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the\nright side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers,\nand the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 7:50 And the bowls, and the\nsnuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure\ngold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house,\nthe most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the\ntemple.\n\n7:51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of\nthe LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had\ndedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put\namong the treasures of the house of the LORD.\n\n8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of\nthe tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto\nking Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.\n\n8:2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon\nat the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.\n\n8:3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the\nark.\n\n8:4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,\neven those did the priests and the Levites bring up.\n\n8:5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were\nassembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep\nand oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.\n\n8:6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD\nunto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,\neven under the wings of the cherubims.\n\n8:7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of\nthe ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof\nabove.\n\n8:8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were\nseen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen\nwithout: and there they are unto this day.\n\n8:9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which\nMoses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the\nchildren of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.\n\n8:10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy\nplace, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 8:11 So that the\npriests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the\nglory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.\n\n8:12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the\nthick darkness.\n\n8:13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place\nfor thee to abide in for ever.\n\n8:14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the\ncongregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)\n8:15 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with\nhis mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,\nsaying, 8:16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out\nof Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an\nhouse, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my\npeople Israel.\n\n8:17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\n\n8:18 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine\nheart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in\nthine heart.\n\n8:19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that\nshall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my\nname.\n\n8:20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am\nrisen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of\nIsrael, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of\nthe LORD God of Israel.\n\n8:21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant\nof the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out\nof the land of Egypt.\n\n8:22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of\nall the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward\nheaven: 8:23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like\nthee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and\nmercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:\n8:24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou\npromisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled\nit with thine hand, as it is this day.\n\n8:25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my\nfather that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a\nman in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children\ntake heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked\nbefore me.\n\n8:26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,\nwhich thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.\n\n8:27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and\nheaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I\nhave builded?  8:28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy\nservant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the\ncry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:\n8:29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even\ntoward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that\nthou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make\ntoward this place.\n\n8:30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy\npeople Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou\nin heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.\n\n8:31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid\nupon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar\nin this house: 8:32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy\nservants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and\njustifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.\n\n8:33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because\nthey have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and\nconfess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this\nhouse: 8:34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy\npeople Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest\nunto their fathers.\n\n8:35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have\nsinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy\nname, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 8:36 Then\nhear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy\npeople Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should\nwalk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people\nfor an inheritance.\n\n8:37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,\nmildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege\nthem in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever\nsickness there be; 8:38 What prayer and supplication soever be made by\nany man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the\nplague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:\n8:39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,\nand give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest;\n(for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of\nmen;) 8:40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the\nland which thou gavest unto our fathers.\n\n8:41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,\nbut cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; 8:42 (For they\nshall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy\nstretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;\n8:43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all\nthat the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth\nmay know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that\nthey may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy\nname.\n\n8:44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever\nthou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city\nwhich thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy\nname: 8:45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their\nsupplication, and maintain their cause.\n\n8:46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)\nand thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that\nthey carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;\n8:47 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they\nwere carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in\nthe land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned,\nand have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; 8:48 And so\nreturn unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the\nland of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee\ntoward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city\nwhich thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:\n8:49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy\ndwelling place, and maintain their cause, 8:50 And forgive thy people\nthat have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein\nthey have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before\nthem who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:\n8:51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou\nbroughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:\n8:52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,\nand unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them\nin all that they call for unto thee.\n\n8:53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the\nearth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses\nthy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD\nGod.\n\n8:54 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all\nthis prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the\naltar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up\nto heaven.\n\n8:55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a\nloud voice, saying, 8:56 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest\nunto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath\nnot failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the\nhand of Moses his servant.\n\n8:57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him\nnot leave us, nor forsake us: 8:58 That he may incline our hearts unto\nhim, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his\nstatutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.\n\n8:59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before\nthe LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he\nmaintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel\nat all times, as the matter shall require: 8:60 That all the people of\nthe earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.\n\n8:61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to\nwalk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.\n\n8:62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before\nthe LORD.\n\n8:63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he\noffered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred\nand twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel\ndedicated the house of the LORD.\n\n8:64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was\nbefore the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings,\nand meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the\nbrasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the\nburnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace\nofferings.\n\n8:65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a\ngreat congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of\nEgypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even\nfourteen days.\n\n8:66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the\nking, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the\ngoodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel\nhis people.\n\n9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the\nhouse of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire\nwhich he was pleased to do, 9:2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the\nsecond time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.\n\n9:3 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\nsupplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\nhouse, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\neyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.\n\n9:4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in\nintegrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I\nhave commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 9:5\nThen I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,\nas I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a\nman upon the throne of Israel.\n\n9:6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your\nchildren, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I\nhave set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:\n9:7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given\nthem; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast\nout of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all\npeople: 9:8 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth\nby it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why\nhath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?  9:9 And\nthey shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who\nbrought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken\nhold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:\ntherefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.\n\n9:10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had\nbuilt the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,\n9:11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar\ntrees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that\nthen king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.\n\n9:12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had\ngiven him; and they pleased him not.\n\n9:13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my\nbrother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.\n\n9:14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.\n\n9:15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for\nto build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the\nwall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.\n\n9:16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt\nit with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and\ngiven it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.\n\n9:17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 9:18 And\nBaalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 9:19 And all the\ncities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and\ncities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in\nJerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.\n\n9:20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,\nPerizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of\nIsrael, 9:21 Their children that were left after them in the land,\nwhom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy,\nupon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.\n\n9:22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but\nthey were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his\ncaptains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.\n\n9:23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's\nwork, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that\nwrought in the work.\n\n9:24 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her\nhouse which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.\n\n9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and\npeace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he\nburnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished\nthe house.\n\n9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is\nbeside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.\n\n9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had\nknowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.\n\n9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four\nhundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.\n\n10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon\nconcerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard\nquestions.\n\n10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels\nthat bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when\nshe was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her\nheart.\n\n10:3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing\nhid from the king, which he told her not.\n\n10:4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and\nthe house that he had built, 10:5 And the meat of his table, and the\nsitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and\ntheir apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up\nunto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.\n\n10:6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in\nmine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.\n\n10:7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had\nseen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and\nprosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.\n\n10:8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand\ncontinually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.\n\n10:9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee\non the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever,\ntherefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.\n\n10:10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and\nof spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more\nsuch abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to\nking Solomon.\n\n10:11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,\nbrought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious\nstones.\n\n10:12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of\nthe LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for\nsingers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.\n\n10:13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,\nwhatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal\nbounty.\n\nSo she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.\n\n10:14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six\nhundred threescore and six talents of gold, 10:15 Beside that he had\nof the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of\nall the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.\n\n10:16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six\nhundred shekels of gold went to one target.\n\n10:17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of\ngold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the\nforest of Lebanon.\n\n10:18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it\nwith the best gold.\n\n10:19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round\nbehind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat,\nand two lions stood beside the stays.\n\n10:20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other\nupon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.\n\n10:21 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all\nthe vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;\nnone were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of\nSolomon.\n\n10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of\nHiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold,\nand silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\n\n10:23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches\nand for wisdom.\n\n10:24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which\nGod had put in his heart.\n\n10:25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and\nvessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and\nmules, a rate year by year.\n\n10:26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had\na thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,\nwhom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at\nJerusalem.\n\n10:27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and\ncedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for\nabundance.\n\n10:28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the\nking's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.\n\n10:29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred\nshekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for\nall the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they\nbring them out by their means.\n\n11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the\ndaughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,\nZidonians, and Hittites: 11:2 Of the nations concerning which the LORD\nsaid unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither\nshall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart\nafter their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.\n\n11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred\nconcubines: and his wives turned away his heart.\n\n11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned\naway his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with\nthe LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.\n\n11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,\nand after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\n\n11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully\nafter the LORD, as did David his father.\n\n11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination\nof Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the\nabomination of the children of Ammon.\n\n11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt\nincense and sacrificed unto their gods.\n\n11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned\nfrom the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 11:10\nAnd had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go\nafter other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.\n\n11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done\nof thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I\nhave commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and\nwill give it to thy servant.\n\n11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy\nfather's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.\n\n11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one\ntribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake\nwhich I have chosen.\n\n11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the\nEdomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.\n\n11:15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the\ncaptain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had\nsmitten every male in Edom; 11:16 (For six months did Joab remain\nthere with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 11:17\nThat Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with\nhim, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.\n\n11:18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took\nmen with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king\nof Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and\ngave him land.\n\n11:19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he\ngave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes\nthe queen.\n\n11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom\nTahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's\nhousehold among the sons of Pharaoh.\n\n11:21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,\nand that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh,\nLet me depart, that I may go to mine own country.\n\n11:22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,\nthat, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he\nanswered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.\n\n11:23 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of\nEliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 11:24 And\nhe gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David\nslew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and\nreigned in Damascus.\n\n11:25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,\nbeside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and\nreigned over Syria.\n\n11:26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,\nSolomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even\nhe lifted up his hand against the king.\n\n11:27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the\nking: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of\nDavid his father.\n\n11:28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon\nseeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over\nall the charge of the house of Joseph.\n\n11:29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of\nJerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;\nand he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in\nthe field: 11:30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him,\nand rent it in twelve pieces: 11:31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee\nten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will\nrend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes\nto thee: 11:32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's\nsake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of\nall the tribes of Israel:) 11:33 Because that they have forsaken me,\nand have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh\nthe god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon,\nand have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine\neyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his\nfather.\n\n11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I\nwill make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's\nsake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:\n11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give\nit unto thee, even ten tribes.\n\n11:36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant\nmay have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have\nchosen me to put my name there.\n\n11:37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that\nthy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.\n\n11:38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command\nthee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to\nkeep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I\nwill be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David,\nand will give Israel unto thee.\n\n11:39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.\n\n11:40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,\nand fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt\nuntil the death of Solomon.\n\n11:41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and\nhis wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?\n11:42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel\nwas forty years.\n\n11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city\nof David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.\n\n12:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem\nto make him king.\n\n12:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet\nin Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king\nSolomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 12:3 That they sent and called\nhim. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake\nunto Rehoboam, saying, 12:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now\ntherefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy\nyoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.\n\n12:5 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again\nto me. And the people departed.\n\n12:6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before\nSolomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that\nI may answer this people?  12:7 And they spake unto him, saying, If\nthou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them,\nand answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy\nservants for ever.\n\n12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given\nhim, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and\nwhich stood before him: 12:9 And he said unto them, What counsel give\nye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make\nthe yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?  12:10 And the\nyoung men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus\nshalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy\nfather made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus\nshalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my\nfather's loins.\n\n12:11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will\nadd to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will\nchastise you with scorpions.\n\n12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,\nas the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.\n\n12:13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old\nmen's counsel that they gave him; 12:14 And spake to them after the\ncounsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and\nI will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but\nI will chastise you with scorpions.\n\n12:15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause\nwas from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD\nspake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n\n12:16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,\nthe people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?\nneither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O\nIsrael: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto\ntheir tents.\n\n12:17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of\nJudah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\n\n12:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and\nall Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king\nRehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to\nJerusalem.\n\n12:19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.\n\n12:20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was\ncome again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and\nmade him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house\nof David, but the tribe of Judah only.\n\n12:21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the\nhouse of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore\nthousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house\nof Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.\n\n12:22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,\n12:23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto\nall the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,\nsaying, 12:24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight\nagainst your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his\nhouse; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word\nof the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the\nLORD.\n\n12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;\nand went out from thence, and built Penuel.\n\n12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to\nthe house of David: 12:27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the\nhouse of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people\nturn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they\nshall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.\n\n12:28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,\nand said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:\nbehold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of\nEgypt.\n\n12:29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.\n\n12:30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship\nbefore the one, even unto Dan.\n\n12:31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the\nlowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.\n\n12:32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the\nfifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and\nhe offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the\ncalves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the\nhigh places which he had made.\n\n12:33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the\nfifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had\ndevised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of\nIsrael: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.\n\n13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of\nthe LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.\n\n13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,\nO altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born\nunto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer\nthe priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's\nbones shall be burnt upon thee.\n\n13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which\nthe LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes\nthat are upon it shall be poured out.\n\n13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the\nman of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put\nforth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,\nwhich he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it\nin again to him.\n\n13:5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,\naccording to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of\nthe LORD.\n\n13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now\nthe face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be\nrestored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the\nking's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.\n\n13:7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and\nrefresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.\n\n13:8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half\nthine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor\ndrink water in this place: 13:9 For so was it charged me by the word\nof the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by\nthe same way that thou camest.\n\n13:10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came\nto Bethel.\n\n13:11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and\ntold him all the works that the man of God had done that day in\nBethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told\nalso to their father.\n\n13:12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons\nhad seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.\n\n13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled\nhim the ass: and he rode thereon, 13:14 And went after the man of God,\nand found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the\nman of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.\n\n13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.\n\n13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:\nneither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:\n13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no\nbread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou\ncamest.\n\n13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel\nspake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with\nthee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he\nlied unto him.\n\n13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and\ndrank water.\n\n13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of\nthe LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 13:21 And he\ncried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the\nLORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast\nnot kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 13:22\nBut camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of\nthe which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water;\nthy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.\n\n13:23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had\ndrunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom\nhe had brought back.\n\n13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:\nand his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion\nalso stood by the carcase.\n\n13:25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,\nand the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the\ncity where the old prophet dwelt.\n\n13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard\nthereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the\nword of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,\nwhich hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,\nwhich he spake unto him.\n\n13:27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they\nsaddled him.\n\n13:28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass\nand the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the\ncarcase, nor torn the ass.\n\n13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid\nit upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the\ncity, to mourn and to bury him.\n\n13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over\nhim, saying, Alas, my brother!  13:31 And it came to pass, after he\nhad buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead,\nthen bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my\nbones beside his bones: 13:32 For the saying which he cried by the\nword of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the\nhouses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall\nsurely come to pass.\n\n13:33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but\nmade again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:\nwhosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests\nof the high places.\n\n13:34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to\ncut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.\n\n14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.\n\n14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise\nthyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get\nthee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me\nthat I should be king over this people.\n\n14:3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of\nhoney, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the\nchild.\n\n14:4 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and\ncame to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes\nwere set by reason of his age.\n\n14:5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam\ncometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and\nthus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in,\nthat she shall feign herself to be another woman.\n\n14:6 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she\ncame in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why\nfeignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy\ntidings.\n\n14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch\nas I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my\npeople Israel, 14:8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David,\nand gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who\nkept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do\nthat only which was right in mine eyes; 14:9 But hast done evil above\nall that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other\ngods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me\nbehind thy back: 14:10 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the\nhouse of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth\nagainst the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will\ntake away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away\ndung, till it be all gone.\n\n14:11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and\nhim that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the\nLORD hath spoken it.\n\n14:12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy\nfeet enter into the city, the child shall die.\n\n14:13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of\nJeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some\ngood thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.\n\n14:14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who\nshall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.\n\n14:15 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the\nwater, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he\ngave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river,\nbecause they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.\n\n14:16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who\ndid sin, and who made Israel to sin.\n\n14:17 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and\nwhen she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 14:18 And\nthey buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word\nof the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the\nprophet.\n\n14:19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he\nreigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the\nkings of Israel.\n\n14:20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:\nand he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.\n\n14:21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was\nforty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\nseventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out\nof all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's\nname was Naamah an Ammonitess.\n\n14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked\nhim to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all\nthat their fathers had done.\n\n14:23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on\nevery high hill, and under every green tree.\n\n14:24 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did\naccording to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast\nout before the children of Israel.\n\n14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that\nShishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 14:26 And he took\naway the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the\nking's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields\nof gold which Solomon had made.\n\n14:27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and\ncommitted them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept\nthe door of the king's house.\n\n14:28 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,\nthat the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard\nchamber.\n\n14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n14:30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.\n\n14:31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\nfathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an\nAmmonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.\n\n15:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat\nreigned Abijam over Judah.\n\n15:2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was\nMaachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\n\n15:3 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done\nbefore him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as\nthe heart of David his father.\n\n15:4 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a\nlamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish\nJerusalem: 15:5 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of\nthe LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him\nall the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the\nHittite.\n\n15:6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of\nhis life.\n\n15:7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And\nthere was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.\n\n15:8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the\ncity of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.\n\n15:9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa\nover Judah.\n\n15:10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his\nmother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\n\n15:11 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did\nDavid his father.\n\n15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all\nthe idols that his fathers had made.\n\n15:13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being\nqueen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her\nidol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.\n\n15:14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart\nwas perfect with the LORD all his days.\n\n15:15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and\nthe things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD,\nsilver, and gold, and vessels.\n\n15:16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all\ntheir days.\n\n15:17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built\nRamah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king\nof Judah.\n\n15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the\ntreasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's\nhouse, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa\nsent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of\nSyria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 15:19 There is a league between\nme and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent\nunto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with\nBaasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.\n\n15:20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of\nthe hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon,\nand Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of\nNaphtali.\n\n15:21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off\nbuilding of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.\n\n15:22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was\nexempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber\nthereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them\nGeba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.\n\n15:23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that\nhe did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time\nof his old age he was diseased in his feet.\n\n15:24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers\nin the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in\nhis stead.\n\n15:25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the\nsecond year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.\n\n15:26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way\nof his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.\n\n15:27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,\nconspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which\nbelonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to\nGibbethon.\n\n15:28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,\nand reigned in his stead.\n\n15:29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the\nhouse of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he\nhad destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he\nspake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 15:30 Because of the sins\nof Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his\nprovocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.\n\n15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n15:32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all\ntheir days.\n\n15:33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of\nAhijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.\n\n15:34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way\nof Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.\n\n16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against\nBaasha, saying, 16:2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and\nmade thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the\nway of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me\nto anger with their sins; 16:3 Behold, I will take away the posterity\nof Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house\nlike the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n\n16:4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him\nthat dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.\n\n16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his\nmight, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings\nof Israel?  16:6 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in\nTirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.\n\n16:7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came\nthe word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for\nall the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to\nanger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam;\nand because he killed him.\n\n16:8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the\nson of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.\n\n16:9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired\nagainst him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house\nof Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.\n\n16:10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty\nand seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.\n\n16:11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat\non his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not\none that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his\nfriends.\n\n16:12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the\nword of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.\n\n16:13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by\nwhich they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking\nthe LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.\n\n16:14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n16:15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri\nreign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against\nGibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.\n\n16:16 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath\nconspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made\nOmri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.\n\n16:17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and\nthey besieged Tirzah.\n\n16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,\nthat he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's\nhouse over him with fire, and died.\n\n16:19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the\nLORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did,\nto make Israel to sin.\n\n16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he\nwrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the\nkings of Israel?  16:21 Then were the people of Israel divided into\ntwo parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to\nmake him king; and half followed Omri.\n\n16:22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people\nthat followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri\nreigned.\n\n16:23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to\nreign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.\n\n16:24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of\nsilver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which\nhe built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.\n\n16:25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse\nthan all that were before him.\n\n16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and\nin his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of\nIsrael to anger with their vanities.\n\n16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might\nthat he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of\nthe kings of Israel?  16:28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was\nburied in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.\n\n16:29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began\nAhab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri\nreigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.\n\n16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above\nall that were before him.\n\n16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to\nwalk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife\nJezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and\nserved Baal, and worshipped him.\n\n16:32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which\nhe had built in Samaria.\n\n16:33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God\nof Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.\n\n16:34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the\nfoundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates\nthereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD,\nwhich he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.\n\n17:1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,\nsaid unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,\nthere shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.\n\n17:2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:3 Get thee\nhence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,\nthat is before Jordan.\n\n17:4 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have\ncommanded the ravens to feed thee there.\n\n17:5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he\nwent and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.\n\n17:6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and\nbread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.\n\n17:7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,\nbecause there had been no rain in the land.\n\n17:8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:9 Arise, get\nthee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold,\nI have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.\n\n17:10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate\nof the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks:\nand he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water\nin a vessel, that I may drink.\n\n17:11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,\nBring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.\n\n17:12 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but\nan handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and,\nbehold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for\nme and my son, that we may eat it, and die.\n\n17:13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:\nbut make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and\nafter make for thee and for thy son.\n\n17:14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall\nnot waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the\nLORD sendeth rain upon the earth.\n\n17:15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she,\nand he, and her house, did eat many days.\n\n17:16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil\nfail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.\n\n17:17 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the\nwoman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so\nsore, that there was no breath left in him.\n\n17:18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou\nman of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and\nto slay my son?  17:19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he\ntook him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he\nabode, and laid him upon his own bed.\n\n17:20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou\nalso brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her\nson?  17:21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and\ncried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this\nchild's soul come into him again.\n\n17:22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the\nchild came into him again, and he revived.\n\n17:23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the\nchamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah\nsaid, See, thy son liveth.\n\n17:24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a\nman of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.\n\n18:1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD\ncame to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab;\nand I will send rain upon the earth.\n\n18:2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore\nfamine in Samaria.\n\n18:3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.\n(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 18:4 For it was so, when Jezebel\ncut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred\nprophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and\nwater.)  18:5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all\nfountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find\ngrass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the\nbeasts.\n\n18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab\nwent one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.\n\n18:7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he\nknew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord\nElijah?  18:8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold,\nElijah is here.\n\n18:9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy\nservant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  18:10 As the LORD thy God\nliveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent\nto seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of\nthe kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.\n\n18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.\n\n18:12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that\nthe Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so\nwhen I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me:\nbut I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.\n\n18:13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the\nprophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets\nby fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  18:14 And now\nthou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall\nslay me.\n\n18:15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I\nstand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.\n\n18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to\nmeet Elijah.\n\n18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto\nhim, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  18:18 And he answered, I have\nnot troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have\nforsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.\n\n18:19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount\nCarmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the\nprophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.\n\n18:20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the\nprophets together unto mount Carmel.\n\n18:21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye\nbetween two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal,\nthen follow him. And the people answered him not a word.\n\n18:22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a\nprophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty\nmen.\n\n18:23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one\nbullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and\nput no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on\nwood, and put no fire under: 18:24 And call ye on the name of your\ngods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that\nanswereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and\nsaid, It is well spoken.\n\n18:25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one\nbullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call\non the name of your gods, but put no fire under.\n\n18:26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed\nit, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,\nsaying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that\nanswered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.\n\n18:27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,\nCry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing,\nor he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be\nawaked.\n\n18:28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with\nknives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.\n\n18:29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied\nuntil the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there\nwas neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.\n\n18:30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all\nthe people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD\nthat was broken down.\n\n18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the\ntribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came,\nsaying, Israel shall be thy name: 18:32 And with the stones he built\nan altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the\naltar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.\n\n18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and\nlaid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour\nit on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.\n\n18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second\ntime.\n\nAnd he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.\n\n18:35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the\ntrench also with water.\n\n18:36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening\nsacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of\nAbraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art\nGod in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all\nthese things at thy word.\n\n18:37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou\nart the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.\n\n18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt\nsacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up\nthe water that was in the trench.\n\n18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and\nthey said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.\n\n18:40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not\none of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down\nto the brook Kishon, and slew them there.\n\n18:41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there\nis a sound of abundance of rain.\n\n18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the\ntop of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his\nface between his knees, 18:43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look\ntoward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is\nnothing. And he said, Go again seven times.\n\n18:44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,\nthere ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he\nsaid, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down\nthat the rain stop thee not.\n\n18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black\nwith clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and\nwent to Jezreel.\n\n18:46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his\nloins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.\n\n19:1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he\nhad slain all the prophets with the sword.\n\n19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the\ngods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of\none of them by to morrow about this time.\n\n19:3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came\nto Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.\n\n19:4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came\nand sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that\nhe might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life;\nfor I am not better than my fathers.\n\n19:5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an\nangel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.\n\n19:6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,\nand a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid\nhim down again.\n\n19:7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched\nhim, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for\nthee.\n\n19:8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of\nthat meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.\n\n19:9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,\nthe word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest\nthou here, Elijah?  19:10 And he said, I have been very jealous for\nthe LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy\ncovenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the\nsword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it\naway.\n\n19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.\n\nAnd, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the\nmountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD\nwas not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD\nwas not in the earthquake: 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; but\nthe LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\n\n19:13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in\nhis mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.\nAnd, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou\nhere, Elijah?  19:14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the\nLORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy\ncovenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the\nsword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it\naway.\n\n19:15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the\nwilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king\nover Syria: 19:16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be\nking over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt\nthou anoint to be prophet in thy room.\n\n19:17 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of\nHazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu\nshall Elisha slay.\n\n19:18 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which\nhave not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.\n\n19:19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who\nwas plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the\ntwelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.\n\n19:20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I\npray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.\nAnd he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?\n19:21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew\nthem, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and\ngave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after\nElijah, and ministered unto him.\n\n20:1 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:\nand there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and\nchariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.\n\n20:2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and\nsaid unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, 20:3 Thy silver and thy gold is\nmine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.\n\n20:4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,\naccording to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.\n\n20:5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,\nsaying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me\nthy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 20:6 Yet I\nwill send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they\nshall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall\nbe, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in\ntheir hand, and take it away.\n\n20:7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and\nsaid, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he\nsent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and\nfor my gold; and I denied him not.\n\n20:8 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not\nunto him, nor consent.\n\n20:9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord\nthe king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I\nwill do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and\nbrought him word again.\n\n20:10 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,\nand more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for\nall the people that follow me.\n\n20:11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him\nthat girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.\n\n20:12 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he\nwas drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his\nservants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array\nagainst the city.\n\n20:13 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,\nsaying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?\nbehold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt\nknow that I am the LORD.\n\n20:14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even\nby the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who\nshall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.\n\n20:15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,\nand they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered\nall the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.\n\n20:16 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself\ndrunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings\nthat helped him.\n\n20:17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out\nfirst; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men\ncome out of Samaria.\n\n20:18 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them\nalive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.\n\n20:19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of\nthe city, and the army which followed them.\n\n20:20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and\nIsrael pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an\nhorse with the horsemen.\n\n20:21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and\nchariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.\n\n20:22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,\nGo, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the\nreturn of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.\n\n20:23 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods\nare gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let\nus fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger\nthan they.\n\n20:24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his\nplace, and put captains in their rooms: 20:25 And number thee an army,\nlike the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for\nchariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we\nshall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and\ndid so.\n\n20:26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad\nnumbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.\n\n20:27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present,\nand went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them\nlike two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.\n\n20:28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,\nand said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD\nis God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will\nI deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know\nthat I am the LORD.\n\n20:29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so\nit was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the\nchildren of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in\none day.\n\n20:30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell\nupon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad\nfled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.\n\n20:31 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that\nthe kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray\nthee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out\nto the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.\n\n20:32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their\nheads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad\nsaith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is\nmy brother.\n\n20:33 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come\nfrom him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother\nBenhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to\nhim; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.\n\n20:34 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took\nfrom thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee\nin Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send\nthee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent\nhim away.\n\n20:35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his\nneighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man\nrefused to smite him.\n\n20:36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of\nthe LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall\nslay thee.\n\nAnd as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew\nhim.\n\n20:37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And\nthe man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.\n\n20:38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and\ndisguised himself with ashes upon his face.\n\n20:39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,\nThy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man\nturned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if\nby any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or\nelse thou shalt pay a talent of silver.\n\n20:40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the\nking of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast\ndecided it.\n\n20:41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the\nking of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.\n\n20:42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let\ngo out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,\ntherefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his\npeople.\n\n20:43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,\nand came to Samaria.\n\n21:1 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the\nJezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of\nAhab king of Samaria.\n\n21:2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I\nmay have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house:\nand I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem\ngood to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.\n\n21:3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should\ngive the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.\n\n21:4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the\nword which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I\nwill not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down\nupon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.\n\n21:5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy\nspirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?  21:6 And he said unto her,\nBecause I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me\nthy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee\nanother vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my\nvineyard.\n\n21:7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the\nkingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry:\nI will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\n\n21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his\nseal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were\nin his city, dwelling with Naboth.\n\n21:9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set\nNaboth on high among the people: 21:10 And set two men, sons of\nBelial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst\nblaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him,\nthat he may die.\n\n21:11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were\nthe inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as\nit was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.\n\n21:12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.\n\n21:13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before\nhim: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth,\nin the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and\nthe king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him\nwith stones, that he died.\n\n21:14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is\ndead.\n\n21:15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,\nand was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the\nvineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for\nmoney: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.\n\n21:16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that\nAhab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to\ntake possession of it.\n\n21:17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\n21:18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:\nbehold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to\npossess it.\n\n21:19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast\nthou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him,\nsaying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood\nof Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.\n\n21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And\nhe answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work\nevil in the sight of the LORD.\n\n21:21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy\nposterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the\nwall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 21:22 And will make\nthine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the\nhouse of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou\nhast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.\n\n21:23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat\nJezebel by the wall of Jezreel.\n\n21:24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him\nthat dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.\n\n21:25 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to\nwork wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife\nstirred up.\n\n21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all\nthings as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children\nof Israel.\n\n21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent\nhis clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in\nsackcloth, and went softly.\n\n21:28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\n21:29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he\nhumbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but\nin his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.\n\n22:1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and\nIsrael.\n\n22:2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king\nof Judah came down to the king of Israel.\n\n22:3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that\nRamoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the\nhand of the king of Syria?  22:4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt\nthou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the\nking of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses\nas thy horses.\n\n22:5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray\nthee, at the word of the LORD to day.\n\n22:6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about\nfour hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead\nto battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD\nshall deliver it into the hand of the king.\n\n22:7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD\nbesides, that we might enquire of him?  22:8 And the king of Israel\nsaid unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah,\nby whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not\nprophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not\nthe king say so.\n\n22:9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten\nhither Micaiah the son of Imlah.\n\n22:10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat\neach on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the\nentrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied\nbefore them.\n\n22:11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he\nsaid, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians,\nuntil thou have consumed them.\n\n22:12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to\nRamothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the\nking's hand.\n\n22:13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,\nsaying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the\nking with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of\none of them, and speak that which is good.\n\n22:14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto\nme, that will I speak.\n\n22:15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,\nshall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And\nhe answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into\nthe hand of the king.\n\n22:16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee\nthat thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the\nLORD?  22:17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills,\nas sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no\nmaster: let them return every man to his house in peace.\n\n22:18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell\nthee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?  22:19\nAnd he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD\nsitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on\nhis right hand and on his left.\n\n22:20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up\nand fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another\nsaid on that manner.\n\n22:21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and\nsaid, I will persuade him.\n\n22:22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go\nforth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.\nAnd he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and\ndo so.\n\n22:23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the\nmouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil\nconcerning thee.\n\n22:24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah\non the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me\nto speak unto thee?  22:25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in\nthat day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.\n\n22:26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back\nunto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 22:27\nAnd say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed\nhim with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I\ncome in peace.\n\n22:28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath\nnot spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.\n\n22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up\nto Ramothgilead.\n\n22:30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise\nmyself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the\nking of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.\n\n22:31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that\nhad rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor\ngreat, save only with the king of Israel.\n\n22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw\nJehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they\nturned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.\n\n22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived\nthat it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from\npursuing him.\n\n22:34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of\nIsrael between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the\ndriver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host;\nfor I am wounded.\n\n22:35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in\nhis chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran\nout of the wound into the midst of the chariot.\n\n22:36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the\ngoing down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to\nhis own country.\n\n22:37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried\nthe king in Samaria.\n\n22:38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs\nlicked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the\nword of the LORD which he spake.\n\n22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the\nivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n22:40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in\nhis stead.\n\n22:41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the\nfourth year of Ahab king of Israel.\n\n22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to\nreign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his\nmother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\n\n22:43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not\naside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD:\nnevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people\noffered and burnt incense yet in the high places.\n\n22:44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.\n\n22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he\nshewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Judah?  22:46 And the remnant of the\nsodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out\nof the land.\n\n22:47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.\n\n22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but\nthey went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.\n\n22:49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my\nservants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.\n\n22:50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\nfathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned\nin his stead.\n\n22:51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria\nthe seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two\nyears over Israel.\n\n22:52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way\nof his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 22:53 For he served\nBaal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of\nIsrael, according to all that his father had done.\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Book of the Kings\n\nCommonly Called:\n\nThe Fourth Book of the Kings\n\n\n1:1 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.\n\n1:2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that\nwas in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto\nthem, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall\nrecover of this disease.\n\n1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go\nup to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,\nIs it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire\nof Baalzebub the god of Ekron?  1:4 Now therefore thus saith the LORD,\nThou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but\nshalt surely die. And Elijah departed.\n\n1:5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them,\nWhy are ye now turned back?  1:6 And they said unto him, There came a\nman up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that\nsent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because\nthere is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of\nBaalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from\nthat bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\n\n1:7 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to\nmeet you, and told you these words?  1:8 And they answered him, He was\nan hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And\nhe said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.\n\n1:9 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And\nhe went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he\nspake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.\n\n1:10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a\nman of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and\nthy fifty.\n\nAnd there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\n\n1:11 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his\nfifty.\n\nAnd he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king\nsaid, Come down quickly.\n\n1:12 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let\nfire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the\nfire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\n\n1:13 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.\nAnd the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees\nbefore Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I\npray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be\nprecious in thy sight.\n\n1:14 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two\ncaptains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my\nlife now be precious in thy sight.\n\n1:15 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be\nnot afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.\n\n1:16 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast\nsent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not\nbecause there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore\nthou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but\nshalt surely die.\n\n1:17 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had\nspoken.\n\nAnd Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son\nof Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.\n\n1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  2:1 And\nit came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a\nwhirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.\n\n2:2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD\nhath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth,\nand as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to\nBethel.\n\n2:3 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to\nElisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away\nthy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye\nyour peace.\n\n2:4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the\nLORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as\nthy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.\n\n2:5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,\nand said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy\nmaster from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye\nyour peace.\n\n2:6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD\nhath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy\nsoul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.\n\n2:7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view\nafar off: and they two stood by Jordan.\n\n2:8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the\nwaters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two\nwent over on dry ground.\n\n2:9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said\nunto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from\nthee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit\nbe upon me.\n\n2:10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou\nsee me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if\nnot, it shall not be so.\n\n2:11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,\nbehold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and\nparted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into\nheaven.\n\n2:12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the\nchariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more:\nand he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.\n\n2:13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went\nback, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 2:14 And he took the mantle of\nElijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is\nthe LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they\nparted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.\n\n2:15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho\nsaw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they\ncame to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.\n\n2:16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants\nfifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest\nperadventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him\nupon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not\nsend.\n\n2:17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They\nsent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him\nnot.\n\n2:18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he\nsaid unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?  2:19 And the men of\nthe city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this\ncity is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the\nground barren.\n\n2:20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they\nbrought it to him.\n\n2:21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the\nsalt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these\nwaters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.\n\n2:22 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying\nof Elisha which he spake.\n\n2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by\nthe way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked\nhim, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.\n\n2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the\nname of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood,\nand tare forty and two children of them.\n\n2:25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he\nreturned to Samaria.\n\n3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria\nthe eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve\nyears.\n\n3:2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his\nfather, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that\nhis father had made.\n\n3:3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of\nNebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.\n\n3:4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the\nking of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand\nrams, with the wool.\n\n3:5 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab\nrebelled against the king of Israel.\n\n3:6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered\nall Israel.\n\n3:7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The\nking of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against\nMoab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people\nas thy people, and my horses as thy horses.\n\n3:8 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way\nthrough the wilderness of Edom.\n\n3:9 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of\nEdom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was\nno water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.\n\n3:10 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called\nthese three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!\n3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,\nthat we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of\nIsrael's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of\nShaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.\n\n3:12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the\nking of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.\n\n3:13 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with\nthee?  get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of\nthy mother.\n\nAnd the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called\nthese three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.\n\n3:14 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I\nstand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat\nthe king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.\n\n3:15 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the\nminstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.\n\n3:16 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of\nditches.\n\n3:17 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye\nsee rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may\ndrink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.\n\n3:18 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will\ndeliver the Moabites also into your hand.\n\n3:19 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and\nshall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every\ngood piece of land with stones.\n\n3:20 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was\noffered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the\ncountry was filled with water.\n\n3:21 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to\nfight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour,\nand upward, and stood in the border.\n\n3:22 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the\nwater, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as\nblood: 3:23 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain,\nand they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.\n\n3:24 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up\nand smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went\nforward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.\n\n3:25 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land\ncast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the\nwells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth\nleft they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and\nsmote it.\n\n3:26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for\nhim, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break\nthrough even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.\n\n3:27 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his\nstead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there\nwas great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and\nreturned to their own land.\n\n4:1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the\nprophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou\nknowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come\nto take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.\n\n4:2 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what\nhast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any\nthing in the house, save a pot of oil.\n\n4:3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy\nneighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.\n\n4:4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and\nupon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou\nshalt set aside that which is full.\n\n4:5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her\nsons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.\n\n4:6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said\nunto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is\nnot a vessel more. And the oil stayed.\n\n4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the\noil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.\n\n4:8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a\ngreat woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that\nas oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.\n\n4:9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is\nan holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.\n\n4:10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let\nus set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a\ncandlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn\nin thither.\n\n4:11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into\nthe chamber, and lay there.\n\n4:12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when\nhe had called her, she stood before him.\n\n4:13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been\ncareful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?\nwouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the\nhost? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.\n\n4:14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi\nanswered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.\n\n4:15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in\nthe door.\n\n4:16 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,\nthou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God,\ndo not lie unto thine handmaid.\n\n4:17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that\nElisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.\n\n4:18 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out\nto his father to the reapers.\n\n4:19 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a\nlad, Carry him to his mother.\n\n4:20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat\non her knees till noon, and then died.\n\n4:21 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and\nshut the door upon him, and went out.\n\n4:22 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,\none of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man\nof God, and come again.\n\n4:23 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither\nnew moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.\n\n4:24 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go\nforward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.\n\n4:25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it\ncame to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to\nGehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: 4:26 Run now, I\npray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it\nwell with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It\nis well: 4:27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she\ncaught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And\nthe man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her:\nand the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.\n\n4:28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do\nnot deceive me?  4:29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and\ntake my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man,\nsalute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay\nmy staff upon the face of the child.\n\n4:30 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy\nsoul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.\n\n4:31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the\nface of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore\nhe went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not\nawaked.\n\n4:32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was\ndead, and laid upon his bed.\n\n4:33 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and\nprayed unto the LORD.\n\n4:34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon\nhis mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands:\nand stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed\nwarm.\n\n4:35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went\nup, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times,\nand the child opened his eyes.\n\n4:36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he\ncalled her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy\nson.\n\n4:37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the\nground, and took up her son, and went out.\n\n4:38 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the\nland; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he\nsaid unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for\nthe sons of the prophets.\n\n4:39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild\nvine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and\nshred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.\n\n4:40 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as\nthey were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou\nman of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.\n\n4:41 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he\nsaid, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no\nharm in the pot.\n\n4:42 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of\nGod bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears\nof corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that\nthey may eat.\n\n4:43 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred\nmen?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus\nsaith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.\n\n4:44 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,\naccording to the word of the LORD.\n\n5:1 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great\nman with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given\ndeliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was\na leper.\n\n5:2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away\ncaptive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on\nNaaman's wife.\n\n5:3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the\nprophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.\n\n5:4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the\nmaid that is of the land of Israel.\n\n5:5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter\nunto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten\ntalents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of\nraiment.\n\n5:6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when\nthis letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my\nservant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.\n\n5:7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,\nthat he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make\nalive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his\nleprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a\nquarrel against me.\n\n5:8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king\nof Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,\nWherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he\nshall know that there is a prophet in Israel.\n\n5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at\nthe door of the house of Elisha.\n\n5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in\nJordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou\nshalt be clean.\n\n5:11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,\nHe will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the\nLORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the\nleper.\n\n5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all\nthe waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he\nturned and went away in a rage.\n\n5:13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My\nfather, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou\nnot have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash,\nand be clean?  5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times\nin Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh\ncame again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\n\n5:15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and\ncame, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there\nis no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee,\ntake a blessing of thy servant.\n\n5:16 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will\nreceive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.\n\n5:17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to\nthy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will\nhenceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods,\nbut unto the LORD.\n\n5:18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master\ngoeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my\nhand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself\nin the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.\n\n5:19 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a\nlittle way.\n\n5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,\nmy master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his\nhands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after\nhim, and take somewhat of him.\n\n5:21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running\nafter him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is\nall well?  5:22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me,\nsaying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two\nyoung men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a\ntalent of silver, and two changes of garments.\n\n5:23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him,\nand bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of\ngarments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them\nbefore him.\n\n5:24 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and\nbestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.\n\n5:25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto\nhim, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no\nwhither.\n\n5:26 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man\nturned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive\nmoney, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and\nsheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?  5:27 The leprosy\ntherefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for\never. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.\n\n6:1 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the\nplace where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.\n\n6:2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a\nbeam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he\nanswered, Go ye.\n\n6:3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.\nAnd he answered, I will go.\n\n6:4 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down\nwood.\n\n6:5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water:\nand he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.\n\n6:6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the\nplace.\n\nAnd he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did\nswim.\n\n6:7 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,\nand took it.\n\n6:8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel\nwith his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.\n\n6:9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware\nthat thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come\ndown.\n\n6:10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God\ntold him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor\ntwice.\n\n6:11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for\nthis thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye\nnot shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?  6:12 And one of\nhis servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that\nis in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest\nin thy bedchamber.\n\n6:13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch\nhim.\n\nAnd it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.\n\n6:14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:\nand they came by night, and compassed the city about.\n\n6:15 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone\nforth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and\nchariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we\ndo?  6:16 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more\nthan they that be with them.\n\n6:17 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,\nthat he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he\nsaw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire\nround about Elisha.\n\n6:18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and\nsaid, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote\nthem with blindness according to the word of Elisha.\n\n6:19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this\nthe city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But\nhe led them to Samaria.\n\n6:20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that\nElisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And\nthe LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in\nthe midst of Samaria.\n\n6:21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My\nfather, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?  6:22 And he answered,\nThou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast\ntaken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water\nbefore them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.\n\n6:23 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten\nand drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the\nbands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.\n\n6:24 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria\ngathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.\n\n6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they\nbesieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of\nsilver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of\nsilver.\n\n6:26 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there\ncried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.\n\n6:27 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help\nthee?  out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?  6:28 And the\nking said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman\nsaid unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will\neat my son to morrow.\n\n6:29 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the\nnext day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.\n\n6:30 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman,\nthat he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the\npeople looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.\n\n6:31 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of\nElisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.\n\n6:32 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the\nking sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he\nsaid to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to\ntake away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door,\nand hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet\nbehind him?  6:33 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the\nmessenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the\nLORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?  7:1 Then Elisha\nsaid, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow\nabout this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel,\nand two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.\n\n7:2 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God,\nand said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this\nthing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but\nshalt not eat thereof.\n\n7:3 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate:\nand they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?  7:4 If we\nsay, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and\nwe shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now\ntherefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they\nsave us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.\n\n7:5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the\nSyrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of\nSyria, behold, there was no man there.\n\n7:6 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of\nchariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and\nthey said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us\nthe kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come\nupon us.\n\n7:7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their\ntents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and\nfled for their life.\n\n7:8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they\nwent into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver,\nand gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and\nentered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid\nit.\n\n7:9 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day\nof good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning\nlight, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we\nmay go and tell the king's household.\n\n7:10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they\ntold them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,\nthere was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and\nasses tied, and the tents as they were.\n\n7:11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house\nwithin.\n\n7:12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I\nwill now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we\nbe hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves\nin the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch\nthem alive, and get into the city.\n\n7:13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray\nthee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city,\n(behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it:\nbehold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites\nthat are consumed:) and let us send and see.\n\n7:14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after\nthe host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.\n\n7:15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was\nfull of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their\nhaste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.\n\n7:16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So\na measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of\nbarley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.\n\n7:17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have\nthe charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and\nhe died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down\nto him.\n\n7:18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,\nsaying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine\nflour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of\nSamaria: 7:19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now,\nbehold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing\nbe? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt\nnot eat thereof.\n\n7:20 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the\ngate, and he died.\n\n8:1 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to\nlife, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn\nwheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine;\nand it shall also come upon the land seven years.\n\n8:2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God:\nand she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the\nPhilistines seven years.\n\n8:3 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman\nreturned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry\nunto the king for her house and for her land.\n\n8:4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,\nsaying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath\ndone.\n\n8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had\nrestored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he\nhad restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her\nland. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is\nher son, whom Elisha restored to life.\n\n8:6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king\nappointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was\nhers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the\nland, even until now.\n\n8:7 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was\nsick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.\n\n8:8 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and\ngo, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall\nI recover of this disease?  8:9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a\npresent with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels'\nburden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king\nof Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this\ndisease?  8:10 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest\ncertainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall\nsurely die.\n\n8:11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:\nand the man of God wept.\n\n8:12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I\nknow the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their\nstrong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay\nwith the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women\nwith child.\n\n8:13 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should\ndo this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that\nthou shalt be king over Syria.\n\n8:14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to\nhim, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou\nshouldest surely recover.\n\n8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,\nand dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died:\nand Hazael reigned in his stead.\n\n8:16 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,\nJehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat\nking of Judah began to reign.\n\n8:17 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he\nreigned eight years in Jerusalem.\n\n8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house\nof Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the\nsight of the LORD.\n\n8:19 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's\nsake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his\nchildren.\n\n8:20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made\na king over themselves.\n\n8:21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he\nrose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and\nthe captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.\n\n8:22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.\nThen Libnah revolted at the same time.\n\n8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  8:24\nAnd Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in\nthe city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.\n\n8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did\nAhaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.\n\n8:26 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and\nhe reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah,\nthe daughter of Omri king of Israel.\n\n8:27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in\nthe sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in\nlaw of the house of Ahab.\n\n8:28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael\nking of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.\n\n8:29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds\nwhich the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against\nHazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah\nwent down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was\nsick.\n\n9:1 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,\nand said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in\nthine hand, and go to Ramothgilead: 9:2 And when thou comest thither,\nlook out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go\nin, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an\ninner chamber; 9:3 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head,\nand say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.\nThen open the door, and flee, and tarry not.\n\n9:4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to\nRamothgilead.\n\n9:5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;\nand he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto\nwhich of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.\n\n9:6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on\nhis head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have\nanointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.\n\n9:7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may\navenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the\nservants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.\n\n9:8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from\nAhab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and\nleft in Israel: 9:9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house\nof Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of\nAhijah: 9:10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel,\nand there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.\n\n9:11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said\nunto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he\nsaid unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.\n\n9:12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and\nthus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee\nking over Israel.\n\n9:13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it\nunder him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying,\nJehu is king.\n\n9:14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired\nagainst Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel,\nbecause of Hazael king of Syria.\n\n9:15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds\nwhich the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of\nSyria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth\nnor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.\n\n9:16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay\nthere.\n\nAnd Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.\n\n9:17 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied\nthe company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram\nsaid, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it\npeace?  9:18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said,\nThus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do\nwith peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The\nmessenger came to them, but he cometh not again.\n\n9:19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and\nsaid, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast\nthou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.\n\n9:20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh\nnot again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of\nNimshi; for he driveth furiously.\n\n9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And\nJoram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his\nchariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of\nNaboth the Jezreelite.\n\n9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it\npeace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of\nthy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?  9:23 And Joram\nturned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O\nAhaziah.\n\n9:24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram\nbetween his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk\ndown in his chariot.\n\n9:25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in\nthe portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how\nthat, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD\nlaid this burden upon him; 9:26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood\nof Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will\nrequite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast\nhim into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.\n\n9:27 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way\nof the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him\nalso in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is\nby Ibleam.\n\nAnd he fled to Megiddo, and died there.\n\n9:28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and\nburied him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.\n\n9:29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah\nto reign over Judah.\n\n9:30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she\npainted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.\n\n9:31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,\nwho slew his master?  9:32 And he lifted up his face to the window,\nand said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or\nthree eunuchs.\n\n9:33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of\nher blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode\nher under foot.\n\n9:34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see\nnow this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.\n\n9:35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the\nskull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.\n\n9:36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the\nword of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,\nsaying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:\n9:37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the\nfield in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is\nJezebel.\n\n10:1 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and\nsent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to\nthem that brought up Ahab's children, saying, 10:2 Now as soon as this\nletter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and\nthere are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and\narmour; 10:3 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons,\nand set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.\n\n10:4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings\nstood not before him: how then shall we stand?  10:5 And he that was\nover the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and\nthe bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy\nservants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any\nking: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.\n\n10:6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be\nmine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the\nmen your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this\ntime. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great\nmen of the city, which brought them up.\n\n10:7 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took\nthe king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in\nbaskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.\n\n10:8 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have\nbrought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two\nheaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.\n\n10:9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,\nand said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired\nagainst my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?  10:10 Know\nnow that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the\nLORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD\nhath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.\n\n10:11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,\nand all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he\nleft him none remaining.\n\n10:12 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at\nthe shearing house in the way, 10:13 Jehu met with the brethren of\nAhaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are\nthe brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the\nking and the children of the queen.\n\n10:14 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew\nthem at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither\nleft he any of them.\n\n10:15 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son\nof Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is\nthine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab\nanswered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his\nhand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.\n\n10:16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they\nmade him ride in his chariot.\n\n10:17 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab\nin Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the\nLORD, which he spake to Elijah.\n\n10:18 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,\nAhab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.\n\n10:19 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his\nservants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great\nsacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not\nlive. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy\nthe worshippers of Baal.\n\n10:20 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they\nproclaimed it.\n\n10:21 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of\nBaal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they\ncame into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one\nend to another.\n\n10:22 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth\nvestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth\nvestments.\n\n10:23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house\nof Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that\nthere be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the\nworshippers of Baal only.\n\n10:24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,\nJehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom\nI have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his\nlife shall be for the life of him.\n\n10:25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering\nthe burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains,\nGo in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with\nthe edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out,\nand went to the city of the house of Baal.\n\n10:26 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and\nburned them.\n\n10:27 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house\nof Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.\n\n10:28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.\n\n10:29 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\nIsrael to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden\ncalves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.\n\n10:30 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in\nexecuting that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the\nhouse of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of\nthe fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.\n\n10:31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of\nIsrael with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of\nJeroboam, which made Israel to sin.\n\n10:32 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael\nsmote them in all the coasts of Israel; 10:33 From Jordan eastward,\nall the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the\nManassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and\nBashan.\n\n10:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all\nhis might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the\nkings of Israel?  10:35 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they\nburied him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.\n\n10:36 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty\nand eight years.\n\n11:1 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was\ndead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.\n\n11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,\ntook Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's\nsons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in\nthe bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.\n\n11:3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And\nAthaliah did reign over the land.\n\n11:4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over\nhundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him\ninto the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an\noath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.\n\n11:5 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall\ndo; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be\nkeepers of the watch of the king's house; 11:6 And a third part shall\nbe at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard:\nso shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.\n\n11:7 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they\nshall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.\n\n11:8 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his\nweapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be\nslain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.\n\n11:9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things\nthat Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men\nthat were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on\nthe sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.\n\n11:10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king\nDavid's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.\n\n11:11 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,\nround about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left\ncorner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.\n\n11:12 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him,\nand gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him;\nand they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.\n\n11:13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the\npeople, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.\n\n11:14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the\nmanner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all\nthe people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah\nrent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.\n\n11:15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,\nthe officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without\nthe ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the\npriest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.\n\n11:16 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which\nthe horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.\n\n11:17 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and\nthe people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king\nalso and the people.\n\n11:18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and\nbrake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces\nthoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And\nthe priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.\n\n11:19 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the\nguard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king\nfrom the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the\nguard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.\n\n11:20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in\nquiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.\n\n11:21 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.\n\n12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty\nyears reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of\nBeersheba.\n\n12:2 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all\nhis days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.\n\n12:3 But the high places were not taken away: the people still\nsacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\n\n12:4 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated\nthings that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of\nevery one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set\nat, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into\nthe house of the LORD, 12:5 Let the priests take it to them, every man\nof his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,\nwheresoever any breach shall be found.\n\n12:6 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king\nJehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.\n\n12:7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other\npriests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the\nhouse? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but\ndeliver it for the breaches of the house.\n\n12:8 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,\nneither to repair the breaches of the house.\n\n12:9 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid\nof it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh\ninto the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put\ntherein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.\n\n12:10 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the\nchest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they\nput up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the\nLORD.\n\n12:11 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that\ndid the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and\nthey laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the\nhouse of the LORD, 12:12 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to\nbuy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the\nLORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.\n\n12:13 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of\nsilver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of\nsilver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:\n12:14 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the\nhouse of the LORD.\n\n12:15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they\ndelivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt\nfaithfully.\n\n12:16 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house\nof the LORD: it was the priests'.\n\n12:17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and\ntook it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.\n\n12:18 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that\nJehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah,\nhad dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was\nfound in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's\nhouse, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from\nJerusalem.\n\n12:19 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n12:20 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in\nthe house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.\n\n12:21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of\nShomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with\nhis fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his\nstead.\n\n13:1 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king\nof Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in\nSamaria, and reigned seventeen years.\n\n13:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and\nfollowed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to\nsin; he departed not therefrom.\n\n13:3 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he\ndelivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the\nhand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.\n\n13:4 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him:\nfor he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria\noppressed them.\n\n13:5 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from\nunder the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in\ntheir tents, as beforetime.\n\n13:6 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of\nJeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained\nthe grove also in Samaria.)  13:7 Neither did he leave of the people\nto Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand\nfootmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them\nlike the dust by threshing.\n\n13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and\nhis might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the\nkings of Israel?  13:9 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they\nburied him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.\n\n13:10 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began\nJehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and\nreigned sixteen years.\n\n13:11 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he\ndeparted not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\nIsrael sin: but he walked therein.\n\n13:12 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his\nmight wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  13:13\nAnd Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:\nand Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.\n\n13:14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And\nJoash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face,\nand said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the\nhorsemen thereof.\n\n13:15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto\nhim bow and arrows.\n\n13:16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.\nAnd he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's\nhands.\n\n13:17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then\nElisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's\ndeliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt\nsmite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.\n\n13:18 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto\nthe king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and\nstayed.\n\n13:19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest\nhave smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till\nthou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.\n\n13:20 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the\nMoabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.\n\n13:21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,\nthey spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of\nElisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of\nElisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.\n\n13:22 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of\nJehoahaz.\n\n13:23 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them,\nand had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham,\nIsaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them\nfrom his presence as yet.\n\n13:24 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in\nhis stead.\n\n13:25 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of\nBenhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the\nhand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him,\nand recovered the cities of Israel.\n\n14:1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel\nreigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.\n\n14:2 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and\nreigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was\nJehoaddan of Jerusalem.\n\n14:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not\nlike David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his\nfather did.\n\n14:4 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people\ndid sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.\n\n14:5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his\nhand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.\n\n14:6 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto\nthat which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the\nLORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the\nchildren, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every\nman shall be put to death for his own sin.\n\n14:7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took\nSelah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.\n\n14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son\nof Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the\nface.\n\n14:9 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,\nsaying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in\nLebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed\nby a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.\n\n14:10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee\nup: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to\nthy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?\n14:11 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel\nwent up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the\nface at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.\n\n14:12 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled\nevery man to their tents.\n\n14:13 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son\nof Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem,\nand brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the\ncorner gate, four hundred cubits.\n\n14:14 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that\nwere found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the\nking's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.\n\n14:15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,\nand how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in\nthe book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  14:16 And Jehoash\nslept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of\nIsrael; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.\n\n14:17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death\nof Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.\n\n14:18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  14:19 Now they made a\nconspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they\nsent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.\n\n14:20 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem\nwith his fathers in the city of David.\n\n14:21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen\nyears old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.\n\n14:22 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king\nslept with his fathers.\n\n14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah\nJeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria,\nand reigned forty and one years.\n\n14:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\ndeparted not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\nIsrael to sin.\n\n14:25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto\nthe sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel,\nwhich he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai,\nthe prophet, which was of Gathhepher.\n\n14:26 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very\nbitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper\nfor Israel.\n\n14:27 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel\nfrom under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son\nof Joash.\n\n14:28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and\nhis might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath,\nwhich belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book\nof the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  14:29 And Jeroboam slept\nwith his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son\nreigned in his stead.\n\n15:1 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began\nAzariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.\n\n15:2 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned\ntwo and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah\nof Jerusalem.\n\n15:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that his father Amaziah had done; 15:4 Save that the\nhigh places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense\nstill on the high places.\n\n15:5 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day\nof his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son\nwas over the house, judging the people of the land.\n\n15:6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n15:7 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his\nfathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.\n\n15:8 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did\nZachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.\n\n15:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his\nfathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of\nNebat, who made Israel to sin.\n\n15:10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote\nhim before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.\n\n15:11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written\nin the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.\n\n15:12 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying,\nThy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation.\nAnd so it came to pass.\n\n15:13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and\nthirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in\nSamaria.\n\n15:14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to\nSamaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him,\nand reigned in his stead.\n\n15:15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he\nmade, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the\nkings of Israel.\n\n15:16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the\ncoasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore\nhe smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped\nup.\n\n15:17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began\nMenahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in\nSamaria.\n\n15:18 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\ndeparted not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,\nwho made Israel to sin.\n\n15:19 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem\ngave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him\nto confirm the kingdom in his hand.\n\n15:20 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty\nmen of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the\nking of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not\nthere in the land.\n\n15:21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n15:22 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned\nin his stead.\n\n15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son\nof Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two\nyears.\n\n15:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\ndeparted not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\nIsrael to sin.\n\n15:25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired\nagainst him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's\nhouse, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites:\nand he killed him, and reigned in his room.\n\n15:26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,\nbehold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of\nIsrael.\n\n15:27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the\nson of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned\ntwenty years.\n\n15:28 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\ndeparted not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\nIsrael to sin.\n\n15:29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of\nAssyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh,\nand Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and\ncarried them captive to Assyria.\n\n15:30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the\nson of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his\nstead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.\n\n15:31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold,\nthey are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.\n\n15:32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel\nbegan Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.\n\n15:33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he\nreigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha,\nthe daughter of Zadok.\n\n15:34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did\naccording to all that his father Uzziah had done.\n\n15:35 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed\nand burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate\nof the house of the LORD.\n\n15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n15:37 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the\nking of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.\n\n15:38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\nfathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in\nhis stead.\n\n16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son\nof Jotham king of Judah began to reign.\n\n16:2 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned\nsixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the\nsight of the LORD his God, like David his father.\n\n16:3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made\nhis son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the\nheathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.\n\n16:4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on\nthe hills, and under every green tree.\n\n16:5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel\ncame up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not\novercome him.\n\n16:6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and\ndrave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt\nthere unto this day.\n\n16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,\nsaying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the\nhand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel,\nwhich rise up against me.\n\n16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of\nthe LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a\npresent to the king of Assyria.\n\n16:9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of\nAssyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people\nof it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.\n\n16:10 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of\nAssyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to\nUrijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it,\naccording to all the workmanship thereof.\n\n16:11 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king\nAhaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king\nAhaz came from Damascus.\n\n16:12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the\naltar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.\n\n16:13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and\npoured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace\nofferings, upon the altar.\n\n16:14 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD,\nfrom the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house\nof the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.\n\n16:15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the\ngreat altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat\noffering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with\nthe burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat\noffering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the\nblood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and\nthe brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.\n\n16:16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz\ncommanded.\n\n16:17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the\nlaver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen\nthat were under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.\n\n16:18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house,\nand the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for\nthe king of Assyria.\n\n16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  16:20\nAnd Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in\nthe city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.\n\n17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of\nElah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.\n\n17:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not\nas the kings of Israel that were before him.\n\n17:3 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea\nbecame his servant, and gave him presents.\n\n17:4 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had\nsent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the\nking of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of\nAssyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.\n\n17:5 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and\nwent up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.\n\n17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and\ncarried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in\nHabor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.\n\n17:7 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the\nLORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt,\nfrom under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other\ngods, 17:8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD\ncast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of\nIsrael, which they had made.\n\n17:9 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were\nnot right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places\nin all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced\ncity.\n\n17:10 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and\nunder every green tree: 17:11 And there they burnt incense in all the\nhigh places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before\nthem; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger: 17:12\nFor they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall\nnot do this thing.\n\n17:13 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all\nthe prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil\nways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the\nlaw which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my\nservants the prophets.\n\n17:14 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,\nlike to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD\ntheir God.\n\n17:15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made\nwith their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against\nthem; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the\nheathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had\ncharged them, that they should not do like them.\n\n17:16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and\nmade them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and\nworshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.\n\n17:17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through\nthe fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to\ndo evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.\n\n17:18 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them\nout of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.\n\n17:19 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but\nwalked in the statutes of Israel which they made.\n\n17:20 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted\nthem, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast\nthem out of his sight.\n\n17:21 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made\nJeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from\nfollowing the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.\n\n17:22 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam\nwhich he did; they departed not from them; 17:23 Until the LORD\nremoved Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants\nthe prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to\nAssyria unto this day.\n\n17:24 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from\nCuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed\nthem in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and\nthey possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.\n\n17:25 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that\nthey feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them,\nwhich slew some of them.\n\n17:26 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations\nwhich thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not\nthe manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among\nthem, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of\nthe God of the land.\n\n17:27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of\nthe priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell\nthere, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.\n\n17:28 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria\ncame and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the\nLORD.\n\n17:29 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the\nhouses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation\nin their cities wherein they dwelt.\n\n17:30 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth\nmade Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 17:31 And the Avites\nmade Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in\nfire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\n\n17:32 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest\nof them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the\nhouses of the high places.\n\n17:33 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the\nmanner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.\n\n17:34 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not\nthe LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their\nordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded\nthe children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 17:35 With whom the LORD\nhad made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other\ngods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to\nthem: 17:36 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt\nwith great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him\nshall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.\n\n17:37 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the\ncommandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for\nevermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.\n\n17:38 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;\nneither shall ye fear other gods.\n\n17:39 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you\nout of the hand of all your enemies.\n\n17:40 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former\nmanner.\n\n17:41 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven\nimages, both their children, and their children's children: as did\ntheir fathers, so do they unto this day.\n\n18:1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king\nof Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.\n\n18:2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he\nreigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was\nAbi, the daughter of Zachariah.\n\n18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that David his father did.\n\n18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down\nthe groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had\nmade: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to\nit: and he called it Nehushtan.\n\n18:5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none\nlike him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.\n\n18:6 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,\nbut kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n18:7 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went\nforth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him\nnot.\n\n18:8 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders\nthereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.\n\n18:9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which\nwas the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that\nShalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.\n\n18:10 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth\nyear of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,\nSamaria was taken.\n\n18:11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and\nput them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the\ncities of the Medes: 18:12 Because they obeyed not the voice of the\nLORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the\nservant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.\n\n18:13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king\nof Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took\nthem.\n\n18:14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to\nLachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou\nputtest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto\nHezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty\ntalents of gold.\n\n18:15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house\nof the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.\n\n18:16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the\ntemple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah\nhad overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.\n\n18:17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh\nfrom Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And\nthey went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they\ncame and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the\nhighway of the fuller's field.\n\n18:18 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them\nEliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna\nthe scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.\n\n18:19 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus\nsaith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this\nwherein thou trustest?  18:20 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain\nwords,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou\ntrust, that thou rebellest against me?  18:21 Now, behold, thou\ntrustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on\nwhich if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is\nPharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.\n\n18:22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that\nhe, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and\nhath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar\nin Jerusalem?  18:23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my\nlord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses,\nif thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.\n\n18:24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the\nleast of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots\nand for horsemen?  18:25 Am I now come up without the LORD against\nthis place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this\nland, and destroy it.\n\n18:26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto\nRabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language;\nfor we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in\nthe ears of the people that are on the wall.\n\n18:27 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy\nmaster, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the\nmen which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink\ntheir own piss with you?  18:28 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a\nloud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of\nthe great king, the king of Assyria: 18:29 Thus saith the king, Let\nnot Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out\nof his hand: 18:30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD,\nsaying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be\ndelivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.\n\n18:31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,\nMake an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then\neat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and\ndrink ye every one the waters of his cistern: 18:32 Until I come and\ntake you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a\nland of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye\nmay live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he\npersuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.\n\n18:33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land\nout of the hand of the king of Assyria?  18:34 Where are the gods of\nHamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and\nIvah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?  18:35 Who are\nthey among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their\ncountry out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out\nof mine hand?  18:36 But the people held their peace, and answered him\nnot a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.\n\n18:37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the\nhousehold, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the\nrecorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words\nof Rabshakeh.\n\n19:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent\nhis clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the\nhouse of the LORD.\n\n19:2 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the\nscribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to\nIsaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.\n\n19:3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of\ntrouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to\nthe birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.\n\n19:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,\nwhom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living\nGod; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard:\nwherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.\n\n19:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.\n\n19:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus\nsaith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with\nwhich the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.\n\n19:7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,\nand shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the\nsword in his own land.\n\n19:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring\nagainst Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.\n\n19:9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is\ncome out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto\nHezekiah, saying, 19:10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah,\nsaying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying,\nJerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.\n\n19:11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to\nall lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?\n19:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers\nhave destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of\nEden which were in Thelasar?  19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and\nthe king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena,\nand Ivah?  19:14 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the\nmessengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the\nLORD, and spread it before the LORD.\n\n19:15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of\nIsrael, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even\nthou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven\nand earth.\n\n19:16 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and\nsee: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to\nreproach the living God.\n\n19:17 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the\nnations and their lands, 19:18 And have cast their gods into the fire:\nfor they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone:\ntherefore they have destroyed them.\n\n19:19 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out\nof his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art\nthe LORD God, even thou only.\n\n19:20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith\nthe LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against\nSennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.\n\n19:21 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The\nvirgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to\nscorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.\n\n19:22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast\nthou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against\nthe Holy One of Israel.\n\n19:23 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said,\nWith the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the\nmountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar\ntrees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into\nthe lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.\n\n19:24 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my\nfeet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.\n\n19:25 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient\ntimes that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou\nshouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.\n\n19:26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were\ndismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as\nthe green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted\nbefore it be grown up.\n\n19:27 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and\nthy rage against me.\n\n19:28 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine\nears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy\nlips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.\n\n19:29 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such\nthings as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which\nspringeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and\nplant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.\n\n19:30 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet\nagain take root downward, and bear fruit upward.\n\n19:31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that\nescape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.\n\n19:32 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He\nshall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come\nbefore it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.\n\n19:33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall\nnot come into this city, saith the LORD.\n\n19:34 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and\nfor my servant David's sake.\n\n19:35 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went\nout, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and\nfive thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they\nwere all dead corpses.\n\n19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,\nand dwelt at Nineveh.\n\n19:37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of\nNisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with\nthe sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon\nhis son reigned in his stead.\n\n20:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet\nIsaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the\nLORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.\n\n20:2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,\nsaying, 20:3 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked\nbefore thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that\nwhich is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.\n\n20:4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle\ncourt, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 20:5 Turn again,\nand tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the\nGod of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\ntears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up\nunto the house of the LORD.\n\n20:6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver\nthee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will\ndefend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.\n\n20:7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it\non the boil, and he recovered.\n\n20:8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the\nLORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD\nthe third day?  20:9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the\nLORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the\nshadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?  20:10 And\nHezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten\ndegrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.\n\n20:11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the\nshadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of\nAhaz.\n\n20:12 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of\nBabylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard\nthat Hezekiah had been sick.\n\n20:13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house\nof his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and\nthe precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that\nwas found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all\nhis dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.\n\n20:14 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto\nhim, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And\nHezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.\n\n20:15 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah\nanswered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there\nis nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.\n\n20:16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.\n\n20:17 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that\nwhich thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be\ncarried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.\n\n20:18 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt\nbeget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace\nof the king of Babylon.\n\n20:19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD\nwhich thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and\ntruth be in my days?  20:20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and\nall his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought\nwater into the city, are they not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Judah?  20:21 And Hezekiah slept with his\nfathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.\n\n21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned\nfifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was\nHephzibah.\n\n21:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after\nthe abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the\nchildren of Israel.\n\n21:3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father\nhad destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as\ndid Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and\nserved them.\n\n21:4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD\nsaid, In Jerusalem will I put my name.\n\n21:5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts\nof the house of the LORD.\n\n21:6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,\nand used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he\nwrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to\nanger.\n\n21:7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the\nhouse, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In\nthis house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of\nIsrael, will I put my name for ever: 21:8 Neither will I make the feet\nof Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers;\nonly if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded\nthem, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded\nthem.\n\n21:9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil\nthan did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of\nIsrael.\n\n21:10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 21:11\nBecause Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath\ndone wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him,\nand hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 21:12 Therefore thus\nsaith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon\nJerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall\ntingle.\n\n21:13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the\nplummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man\nwipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.\n\n21:14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver\nthem into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and\na spoil to all their enemies; 21:15 Because they have done that which\nwas evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day\ntheir fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.\n\n21:16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had\nfilled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he\nmade Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the\nLORD.\n\n21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and\nhis sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Judah?  21:18 And Manasseh slept with his\nfathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden\nof Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.\n\n21:19 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he\nreigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was\nMeshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.\n\n21:20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his\nfather Manasseh did.\n\n21:21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and\nserved the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 21:22\nAnd he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way\nof the LORD.\n\n21:23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the\nking in his own house.\n\n21:24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired\nagainst king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king\nin his stead.\n\n21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  21:26\nAnd he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah\nhis son reigned in his stead.\n\n22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\nthirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah,\nthe daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.\n\n22:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and\nwalked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the\nright hand or to the left.\n\n22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that\nthe king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the\nscribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, 22:4 Go up to Hilkiah the\nhigh priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the\nhouse of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the\npeople: 22:5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the\nwork, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them\ngive it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to\nrepair the breaches of the house, 22:6 Unto carpenters, and builders,\nand masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.\n\n22:7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that\nwas delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.\n\n22:8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have\nfound the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave\nthe book to Shaphan, and he read it.\n\n22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king\nword again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was\nfound in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that\ndo the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.\n\n22:10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the\npriest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.\n\n22:11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the\nbook of the law, that he rent his clothes.\n\n22:12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of\nShaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and\nAsahiah a servant of the king's, saying, 22:13 Go ye, enquire of the\nLORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the\nwords of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD\nthat is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened\nunto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is\nwritten concerning us.\n\n22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and\nAsahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son\nof Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt\nin Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.\n\n22:15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell\nthe man that sent you to me, 22:16 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will\nbring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all\nthe words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: 22:17 Because\nthey have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that\nthey might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands;\ntherefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not\nbe quenched.\n\n22:18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD,\nthus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As\ntouching the words which thou hast heard; 22:19 Because thine heart\nwas tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou\nheardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants\nthereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast\nrent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith\nthe LORD.\n\n22:20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou\nshalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not\nsee all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought\nthe king word again.\n\n23:1 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of\nJudah and of Jerusalem.\n\n23:2 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men\nof Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the\npriests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great:\nand he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant\nwhich was found in the house of the LORD.\n\n23:3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the\nLORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his\ntestimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul,\nto perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.\nAnd all the people stood to the covenant.\n\n23:4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests\nof the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out\nof the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and\nfor the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them\nwithout Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of\nthem unto Bethel.\n\n23:5 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah\nhad ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of\nJudah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned\nincense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets,\nand to all the host of heaven.\n\n23:6 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without\nJerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron,\nand stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the\ngraves of the children of the people.\n\n23:7 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the\nhouse of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.\n\n23:8 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and\ndefiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from\nGeba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that\nwere in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the\ncity, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.\n\n23:9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the\naltar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened\nbread among their brethren.\n\n23:10 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children\nof Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass\nthrough the fire to Molech.\n\n23:11 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to\nthe sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber\nof Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned\nthe chariots of the sun with fire.\n\n23:12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of\nAhaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh\nhad made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat\ndown, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into\nthe brook Kidron.\n\n23:13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on\nthe right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of\nIsrael had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and\nfor Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the\nabomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.\n\n23:14 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and\nfilled their places with the bones of men.\n\n23:15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that\naltar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and\nstamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.\n\n23:16 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were\nthere in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the\nsepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according\nto the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who\nproclaimed these words.\n\n23:17 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the\ncity told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from\nJudah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the\naltar of Bethel.\n\n23:18 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they\nlet his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of\nSamaria.\n\n23:19 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the\ncities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the\nLord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the\nacts that he had done in Bethel.\n\n23:20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there\nupon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to\nJerusalem.\n\n23:21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover\nunto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.\n\n23:22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the\njudges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel,\nnor of the kings of Judah; 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of king\nJosiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.\n\n23:24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and\nthe images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in\nthe land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might\nperform the words of the law which were written in the book that\nHilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.\n\n23:25 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to\nthe LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his\nmight, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose\nthere any like him.\n\n23:26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his\ngreat wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of\nall the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.\n\n23:27 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as\nI have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I\nhave chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.\n\n23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n23:29 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king\nof Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him;\nand he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.\n\n23:30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and\nbrought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the\npeople of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him,\nand made him king in his father's stead.\n\n23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign;\nand he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was\nHamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\n\n23:32 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that his fathers had done.\n\n23:33 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of\nHamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a\ntribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.\n\n23:34 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the\nroom of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took\nJehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.\n\n23:35 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he\ntaxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of\nPharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land,\nof every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.\n\n23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign;\nand he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was\nZebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.\n\n23:37 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that his fathers had done.\n\n24:1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim\nbecame his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against\nhim.\n\n24:2 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of\nthe Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of\nAmmon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the\nword of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.\n\n24:3 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to\nremove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to\nall that he did; 24:4 And also for the innocent blood that he shed:\nfor he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not\npardon.\n\n24:5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son\nreigned in his stead.\n\n24:7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:\nfor the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the\nriver Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.\n\n24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he\nreigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta,\nthe daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.\n\n24:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that his father had done.\n\n24:10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came\nup against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.\n\n24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and\nhis servants did besiege it.\n\n24:12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of\nBabylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and\nhis officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of\nhis reign.\n\n24:13 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the\nLORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the\nvessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of\nthe LORD, as the LORD had said.\n\n24:14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all\nthe mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the\ncraftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the\npeople of the land.\n\n24:15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's\nmother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the\nland, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.\n\n24:16 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and\nsmiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the\nking of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.\n\n24:17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king\nin his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.\n\n24:18 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,\nand he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was\nHamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\n\n24:19 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that Jehoiakim had done.\n\n24:20 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem\nand Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah\nrebelled against the king of Babylon.\n\n25:1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth\nmonth, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of\nBabylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched\nagainst it; and they built forts against it round about.\n\n25:2 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king\nZedekiah.\n\n25:3 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in\nthe city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.\n\n25:4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night\nby the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's\ngarden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the\nking went the way toward the plain.\n\n25:5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook\nhim in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from\nhim.\n\n25:6 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon\nto Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.\n\n25:7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out\nthe eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried\nhim to Babylon.\n\n25:8 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is\nthe nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came\nNebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon,\nunto Jerusalem: 25:9 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the\nking's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's\nhouse burnt he with fire.\n\n25:10 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of\nthe guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.\n\n25:11 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the\nfugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of\nthe multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.\n\n25:12 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the\nland to be vinedressers and husbandmen.\n\n25:13 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and\nthe bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did\nthe Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to\nBabylon.\n\n25:14 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,\nand all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they\naway.\n\n25:15 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of\ngold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took\naway.\n\n25:16 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made\nfor the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without\nweight.\n\n25:17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the\nchapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three\ncubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter\nround about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar\nwith wreathen work.\n\n25:18 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and\nZephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 25:19\nAnd out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of\nwar, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were\nfound in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which\nmustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of\nthe land that were found in the city: 25:20 And Nebuzaradan captain of\nthe guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to\nRiblah: 25:21 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at\nRiblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their\nland.\n\n25:22 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.\n\n25:23 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,\nheard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came\nto Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan\nthe son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite,\nand Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.\n\n25:24 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto\nthem, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land,\nand serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.\n\n25:25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son\nof Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten\nmen with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the\nChaldees that were with him at Mizpah.\n\n25:26 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of\nthe armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the\nChaldees.\n\n25:27 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the\ncaptivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the\nseven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of\nBabylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of\nJehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 25:28 And he spake kindly to\nhim, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with\nhim in Babylon; 25:29 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat\nbread continually before him all the days of his life.\n\n25:30 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the\nking, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.\n\n\n\n\nThe First Book of the Chronicles\n\n\n1:1 Adam, Sheth, Enosh, 1:2 Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered, 1:3 Henoch,\nMethuselah, Lamech, 1:4 Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\n1:5 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and\nTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n\n1:6 And the sons of Gomer; Ashchenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n\n1:7 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\n\n1:8 The sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.\n\n1:9 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabta, and Raamah,\nand Sabtecha.

So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was\nchief.\n\n11:7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city\nof David.\n\n11:8 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about:\nand Joab repaired the rest of the city.\n\n11:9 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was\nwith him.\n\n11:10 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who\nstrengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel,\nto make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.\n\n11:11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;\nJashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his\nspear against three hundred slain by him at one time.\n\n11:12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was\none of the three mighties.\n\n11:13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were\ngathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of\nbarley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.\n\n11:14 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and\ndelivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a\ngreat deliverance.\n\n11:15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David,\ninto the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in\nthe valley of Rephaim.\n\n11:16 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison\nwas then at Bethlehem.\n\n11:17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of\nthe water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!  11:18 And\nthe three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water\nout of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and\nbrought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it\nout to the LORD.\n\n11:19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:\nshall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in\njeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.\nTherefore he would not drink it.\n\nThese things did these three mightiest.\n\n11:20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for\nlifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a\nname among the three.\n\n11:21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was\ntheir captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.\n\n11:22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of\nKabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab:\nalso he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.\n\n11:23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits\nhigh; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and\nhe went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the\nEgyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.\n\n11:24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name\namong the three mighties.\n\n11:25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to\nthe first three: and David set him over his guard.\n\n11:26 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of\nJoab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 11:27 Shammoth the\nHarorite, Helez the Pelonite, 11:28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,\nAbiezer the Antothite, 11:29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the\nAhohite, 11:30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the\nNetophathite, 11:31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained\nto the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 11:32 Hurai of\nthe brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 11:33 Azmaveth the\nBaharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 11:34 The sons of Hashem the\nGizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, 11:35 Ahiam the son\nof Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 11:36 Hepher the\nMecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 11:37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai\nthe son of Ezbai, 11:38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of\nHaggeri, 11:39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the\narmourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb\nthe Ithrite, 11:41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 11:42\nAdina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and\nthirty with him, 11:43 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the\nMithnite, 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of\nHothan the Aroerite, 11:45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his\nbrother, the Tizite, 11:46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and\nJoshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, 11:47 Eliel,\nand Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.\n\n12:1 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet\nkept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were\namong the mighty men, helpers of the war.\n\n12:2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and\nthe left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of\nSaul's brethren of Benjamin.\n\n12:3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the\nGibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah,\nand Jehu the Antothite.\n\n12:4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and\nover the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad\nthe Gederathite, 12:5 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and\nShemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, 12:6 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and\nAzareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites, 12:7 And Joelah, and\nZebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.\n\n12:8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the\nhold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the\nbattle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like\nthe faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;\n12:9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 12:10\nMishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 12:11 Attai the sixth,\nEliel the seventh, 12:12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 12:13\nJeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.\n\n12:14 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the\nleast was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.\n\n12:15 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it\nhad overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the\nvalleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.\n\n12:16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold\nunto David.\n\n12:17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto\nthem, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be\nknit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing\nthere is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon,\nand rebuke it.\n\n12:18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains,\nand he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse:\npeace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God\nhelpeth thee.\n\nThen David received them, and made them captains of the band.\n\n12:19 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the\nPhilistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the\nlords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He\nwill fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.\n\n12:20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and\nJozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and\nZilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.\n\n12:21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they\nwere all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.\n\n12:22 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,\nuntil it was a great host, like the host of God.\n\n12:23 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to\nthe war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to\nhim, according to the word of the LORD.\n\n12:24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six\nthousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.\n\n12:25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,\nseven thousand and one hundred.\n\n12:26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.\n\n12:27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were\nthree thousand and seven hundred; 12:28 And Zadok, a young man mighty\nof valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.\n\n12:29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three\nthousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of\nthe house of Saul.\n\n12:30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight\nhundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their\nfathers.\n\n12:31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were\nexpressed by name, to come and make David king.\n\n12:32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had\nunderstanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads\nof them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their\ncommandment.\n\n12:33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with\nall instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they\nwere not of double heart.\n\n12:34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield\nand spear thirty and seven thousand.\n\n12:35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and\nsix hundred.\n\n12:36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty\nthousand.\n\n12:37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the\nGadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of\ninstruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.\n\n12:38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect\nheart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest\nalso of Israel were of one heart to make David king.\n\n12:39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:\nfor their brethren had prepared for them.\n\n12:40 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and\nZebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on\nmules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of\nraisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there\nwas joy in Israel.\n\n13:1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,\nand with every leader.\n\n13:2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem\ngood unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad\nunto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of\nIsrael, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in\ntheir cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:\n13:3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired\nnot at it in the days of Saul.\n\n13:4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the\nthing was right in the eyes of all the people.\n\n13:5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even\nunto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from\nKirjathjearim.\n\n13:6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to\nKirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of\nGod the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is\ncalled on it.\n\n13:7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of\nAbinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.\n\n13:8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might,\nand with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with\ntimbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.\n\n13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put\nforth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.\n\n13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote\nhim, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.\n\n13:11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach\nupon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.\n\n13:12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring\nthe ark of God home to me?  13:13 So David brought not the ark home to\nhimself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of\nObededom the Gittite.\n\n13:14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his\nhouse three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and\nall that he had.\n\n14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of\ncedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.\n\n14:2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over\nIsrael, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people\nIsrael.\n\n14:3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons\nand daughters.\n\n14:4 Now these are the names of his children which he had in\nJerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 14:5 And Ibhar,\nand Elishua, and Elpalet, 14:6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 14:7\nAnd Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.\n\n14:8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over\nall Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard\nof it, and went out against them.\n\n14:9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of\nRephaim.\n\n14:10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the\nPhilistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD\nsaid unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.\n\n14:11 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then\nDavid said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the\nbreaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place\nBaalperazim.\n\n14:12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a\ncommandment, and they were burned with fire.\n\n14:13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the\nvalley.\n\n14:14 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go\nnot up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over\nagainst the mulberry trees.\n\n14:15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the\ntops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for\nGod is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.\n\n14:16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the\nhost of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.\n\n14:17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD\nbrought the fear of him upon all nations.\n\n15:1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a\nplace for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.\n\n15:2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the\nLevites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to\nminister unto him for ever.\n\n15:3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up\nthe ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.\n\n15:4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5\nOf the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred\nand twenty: 15:6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his\nbrethren two hundred and twenty: 15:7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the\nchief and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 15:8 Of the sons of\nElizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 15:9 Of\nthe sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 15:10\nOf the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an\nhundred and twelve.\n\n15:11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the\nLevites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and\nAmminadab, 15:12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers\nof the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that\nye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that\nI have prepared for it.\n\n15:13 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a\nbreach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.\n\n15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up\nthe ark of the LORD God of Israel.\n\n15:15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their\nshoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the\nword of the LORD.\n\n15:16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their\nbrethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and\nharps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.\n\n15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his\nbrethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their\nbrethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 15:18 And with them their\nbrethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and\nShemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah,\nand Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel,\nthe porters.\n\n15:19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound\nwith cymbals of brass; 15:20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and\nShemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and\nBenaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 15:21 And Mattithiah, and\nElipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with\nharps on the Sheminith to excel.\n\n15:22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed\nabout the song, because he was skilful.\n\n15:23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.\n\n15:24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and\nZechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the\ntrumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were\ndoorkeepers for the ark.\n\n15:25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over\nthousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of\nthe house of Obededom with joy.\n\n15:26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the\nark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and\nseven rams.\n\n15:27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the\nLevites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master\nof the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of\nlinen.\n\n15:28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD\nwith shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and\nwith cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.\n\n15:29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came\nto the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at\na window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in\nher heart.\n\n16:1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the\ntent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices\nand peace offerings before God.\n\n16:2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings\nand the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the\nLORD.\n\n16:3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every\none a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.\n\n16:4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the\nark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God\nof Israel: 16:5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and\nShemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and\nObededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a\nsound with cymbals; 16:6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with\ntrumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.\n\n16:7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the\nLORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.\n\n16:8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his\ndeeds among the people.\n\n16:9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous\nworks.\n\n16:10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that\nseek the LORD.\n\n16:11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.\n\n16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,\nand the judgments of his mouth; 16:13 O ye seed of Israel his servant,\nye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.\n\n16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.\n\n16:15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he\ncommanded to a thousand generations; 16:16 Even of the covenant which\nhe made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 16:17 And hath\nconfirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an\neverlasting covenant, 16:18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of\nCanaan, the lot of your inheritance; 16:19 When ye were but few, even\na few, and strangers in it.\n\n16:20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom\nto another people; 16:21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he\nreproved kings for their sakes, 16:22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed,\nand do my prophets no harm.\n\n16:23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day\nhis salvation.\n\n16:24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among\nall nations.\n\n16:25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to\nbe feared above all gods.\n\n16:26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the\nheavens.\n\n16:27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are\nin his place.\n\n16:28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the\nLORD glory and strength.\n\n16:29 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an\noffering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of\nholiness.\n\n16:30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable,\nthat it be not moved.\n\n16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men\nsay among the nations, The LORD reigneth.\n\n16:32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields\nrejoice, and all that is therein.\n\n16:33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the\nLORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.\n\n16:34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy\nendureth for ever.\n\n16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us\ntogether, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to\nthy holy name, and glory in thy praise.\n\n16:36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the\npeople said, Amen, and praised the LORD.\n\n16:37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD\nAsaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as\nevery day's work required: 16:38 And Obededom with their brethren,\nthreescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to\nbe porters: 16:39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests,\nbefore the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at\nGibeon, 16:40 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of\nthe burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do\naccording to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he\ncommanded Israel; 16:41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest\nthat were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the\nLORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; 16:42 And with them Heman\nand Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a\nsound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun\nwere porters.\n\n16:43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David\nreturned to bless his house.\n\n17:1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said\nto Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark\nof the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.\n\n17:2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for\nGod is with thee.\n\n17:3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to\nNathan, saying, 17:4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the\nLORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 17:5 For I have\nnot dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this\nday; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to\nanother.\n\n17:6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any\nof the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying,\nWhy have ye not built me an house of cedars?  17:7 Now therefore thus\nshalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I\ntook thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou\nshouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 17:8 And I have been with\nthee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine\nenemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of\nthe great men that are in the earth.\n\n17:9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant\nthem, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more;\nneither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at\nthe beginning, 17:10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be\nover my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.\nFurthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.\n\n17:11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou\nmust go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after\nthee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.\n\n17:12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for\never.\n\n17:13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not\ntake my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before\nthee: 17:14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for\never: and his throne shall be established for evermore.\n\n17:15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,\nso did Nathan speak unto David.\n\n17:16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who\nam I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me\nhitherto?  17:17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God;\nfor thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to\ncome, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high\ndegree, O LORD God.\n\n17:18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?\nfor thou knowest thy servant.\n\n17:19 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own\nheart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these\ngreat things.\n\n17:20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside\nthee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.\n\n17:21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom\nGod went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of\ngreatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy\npeople whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?  17:22 For thy people\nIsrael didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD,\nbecamest their God.\n\n17:23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken\nconcerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for\never, and do as thou hast said.\n\n17:24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for\never, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to\nIsrael: and let the house of David thy servant be established before\nthee.\n\n17:25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build\nhim an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray\nbefore thee.\n\n17:26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness\nunto thy servant: 17:27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the\nhouse of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou\nblessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.\n\n18:1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,\nand subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the\nPhilistines.\n\n18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and\nbrought gifts.\n\n18:3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went\nto stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.\n\n18:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand\nhorsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the\nchariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.\n\n18:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of\nZobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\n\n18:6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became\nDavid's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David\nwhithersoever he went.\n\n18:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of\nHadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\n\n18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,\nbrought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea,\nand the pillars, and the vessels of brass.\n\n18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the\nhost of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 18:10 He sent Hadoram his son to king\nDavid, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he\nhad fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war\nwith Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and\nbrass.\n\n18:11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver\nand the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and\nfrom Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines,\nand from Amalek.\n\n18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the\nvalley of salt eighteen thousand.\n\n18:13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became\nDavid's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.\n\n18:14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and\njustice among all his people.\n\n18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat\nthe son of Ahilud, recorder.\n\n18:16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,\nwere the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 18:17 And Benaiah the son of\nJehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of\nDavid were chief about the king.\n\n19:1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the\nchildren of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.\n\n19:2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of\nNahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent\nmessengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of\nDavid came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort\nhim.\n\n19:3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest\nthou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters\nunto thee?  are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to\noverthrow, and to spy out the land?  19:4 Wherefore Hanun took David's\nservants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst\nhard by their buttocks, and sent them away.\n\n19:5 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served.\nAnd he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the\nking said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then\nreturn.\n\n19:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves\nodious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand\ntalents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of\nMesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.\n\n19:7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of\nMaachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the\nchildren of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and\ncame to battle.\n\n19:8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the\nmighty men.\n\n19:9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array\nbefore the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by\nthemselves in the field.\n\n19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and\nbehind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in\narray against the Syrians.\n\n19:11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai\nhis brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of\nAmmon.\n\n19:12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou\nshalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee,\nthen I will help thee.\n\n19:13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for\nour people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that\nwhich is good in his sight.\n\n19:14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the\nSyrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.\n\n19:15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,\nthey likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the\ncity. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.\n\n19:16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before\nIsrael, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were\nbeyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer\nwent before them.\n\n19:17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed\nover Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against\nthem. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians,\nthey fought with him.\n\n19:18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the\nSyrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty\nthousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.\n\n19:19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the\nworse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his\nservants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any\nmore.\n\n20:1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time\nthat kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and\nwasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged\nRabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and\ndestroyed it.\n\n20:2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and\nfound it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in\nit; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding\nmuch spoil out of the city.\n\n20:3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with\nsaws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David\nwith all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the\npeople returned to Jerusalem.\n\n20:4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer\nwith the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew\nSippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.\n\n20:5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son\nof Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear\nstaff was like a weaver's beam.\n\n20:6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great\nstature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each\nhand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.\n\n20:7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's\nbrother slew him.\n\n20:8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand\nof David, and by the hand of his servants.\n\n21:1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number\nIsrael.\n\n21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,\nnumber Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them\nto me, that I may know it.\n\n21:3 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so\nmany more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my\nlord's servants?  why then doth my lord require this thing? why will\nhe be a cause of trespass to Israel?  21:4 Nevertheless the king's\nword prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went\nthroughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.\n\n21:5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And\nall they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand\nmen that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten\nthousand men that drew sword.\n\n21:6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's\nword was abominable to Joab.\n\n21:7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote\nIsrael.\n\n21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have\ndone this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy\nservant; for I have done very foolishly.\n\n21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying, 21:10 Go and\ntell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things:\nchoose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.\n\n21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,\nChoose thee 21:12 Either three years' famine; or three months to be\ndestroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies\novertaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the\npestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying\nthroughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what\nword I shall bring again to him that sent me.\n\n21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now\ninto the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me\nnot fall into the hand of man.\n\n21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of\nIsrael seventy thousand men.\n\n21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he\nwas destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and\nsaid to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand.\nAnd the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the\nJebusite.\n\n21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD\nstand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his\nhand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of\nIsrael, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.\n\n21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people\nto be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed;\nbut as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray\nthee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on\nthy people, that they should be plagued.\n\n21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that\nDavid should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the\nthreshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.\n\n21:19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the\nname of the LORD.\n\n21:20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with\nhim hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.\n\n21:21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went\nout of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to\nthe ground.\n\n21:22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this\nthreshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou\nshalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed\nfrom the people.\n\n21:23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the\nking do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also\nfor burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the\nwheat for the meat offering; I give it all.\n\n21:24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for\nthe full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD,\nnor offer burnt offerings without cost.\n\n21:25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold\nby weight.\n\n21:26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt\nofferings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he\nanswered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.\n\n21:27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again\ninto the sheath thereof.\n\n21:28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in\nthe threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.\n\n21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the\nwilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season\nin the high place at Gibeon.\n\n21:30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was\nafraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.\n\n22:1 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is\nthe altar of the burnt offering for Israel.\n\n22:2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in\nthe land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build\nthe house of God.\n\n22:3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors\nof the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without\nweight; 22:4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they\nof Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.\n\n22:5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house\nthat is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of\nfame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make\npreparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.\n\n22:6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an\nhouse for the LORD God of Israel.\n\n22:7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind\nto build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 22:8 But the word\nof the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and\nhast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name,\nbecause thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.\n\n22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest;\nand I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his\nname shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel\nin his days.\n\n22:10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and\nI will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom\nover Israel for ever.\n\n22:11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build\nthe house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.\n\n22:12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee\ncharge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD\nthy God.\n\n22:13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the\nstatutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning\nIsrael: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.\n\n22:14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the\nLORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand\ntalents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in\nabundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add\nthereto.\n\n22:15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and\nworkers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every\nmanner of work.\n\n22:16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is\nno number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.\n\n22:17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon\nhis son, saying, 22:18 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he\nnot given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of\nthe land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and\nbefore his people.\n\n22:19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;\narise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring\nthe ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into\nthe house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.\n\n23:1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son\nking over Israel.\n\n23:2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the\npriests and the Levites.\n\n23:3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and\nupward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and\neight thousand.\n\n23:4 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work\nof the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:\n23:5 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised\nthe LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise\ntherewith.\n\n23:6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,\nnamely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n\n23:7 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.\n\n23:8 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,\nthree.\n\n23:9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.\nThese were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.\n\n23:10 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and\nBeriah.\n\nThese four were the sons of Shimei.\n\n23:11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and\nBeriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning,\naccording to their father's house.\n\n23:12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.\n\n23:13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,\nthat he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for\never, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to\nbless in his name for ever.\n\n23:14 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the\ntribe of Levi.\n\n23:15 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.\n\n23:16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.\n\n23:17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer\nhad none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.\n\n23:18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.\n\n23:19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,\nJahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.\n\n23:20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.\n\n23:21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi.

And who then is willing to consecrate his service this\nday unto the LORD?  29:6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of\nthe tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,\nwith the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly, 29:7 And gave\nfor the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and\nten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass\neighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.\n\n29:8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the\ntreasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the\nGershonite.\n\n29:9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,\nbecause with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and\nDavid the king also rejoiced with great joy.\n\n29:10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:\nand David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for\never and ever.\n\n29:11 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,\nand the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in\nthe earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted\nas head above all.\n\n29:12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all;\nand in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make\ngreat, and to give strength unto all.\n\n29:13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious\nname.\n\n29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to\noffer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and\nof thine own have we given thee.\n\n29:15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all\nour fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none\nabiding.\n\n29:16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build\nthee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all\nthine own.\n\n29:17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast\npleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I\nhave willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy\nthy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.\n\n29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep\nthis for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy\npeople, and prepare their heart unto thee: 29:19 And give unto Solomon\nmy son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and\nthy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for\nthe which I have made provision.\n\n29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your\nGod.\n\nAnd all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and\nbowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.\n\n29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt\nofferings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand\nbullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink\nofferings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 29:22 And did\neat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And\nthey made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed\nhim unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.\n\n29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of\nDavid his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.\n\n29:24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons\nlikewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.\n\n29:25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all\nIsrael, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on\nany king before him in Israel.\n\n29:26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.\n\n29:27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven\nyears reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in\nJerusalem.\n\n29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:\nand Solomon his son reigned in his stead.\n\n29:29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are\nwritten in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the\nprophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 29:30 With all his reign and\nhis might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over\nall the kingdoms of the countries.\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Book of the Chronicles\n\n\n1:1 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and\nthe LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.\n\n1:2 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands\nand of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all\nIsrael, the chief of the fathers.\n\n1:3 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high\nplace that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the\ncongregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in\nthe wilderness.\n\n1:4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the\nplace which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for\nit at Jerusalem.\n\n1:5 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son\nof Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and\nSolomon and the congregation sought unto it.\n\n1:6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,\nwhich was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a\nthousand burnt offerings upon it.\n\n1:7 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask\nwhat I shall give thee.\n\n1:8 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David\nmy father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.\n\n1:9 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be\nestablished: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of\nthe earth in multitude.\n\n1:10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in\nbefore this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so\ngreat?  1:11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart,\nand thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of\nthine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom\nand knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom\nI have made thee king: 1:12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee;\nand I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of\nthe kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any\nafter thee have the like.\n\n1:13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at\nGibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation,\nand reigned over Israel.\n\n1:14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand\nand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he\nplaced in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.\n\n1:15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as\nstones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the\nvale for abundance.\n\n1:16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the\nking's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.\n\n1:17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for\nsix hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty:\nand so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and\nfor the kings of Syria, by their means.\n\n2:1 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD,\nand an house for his kingdom.\n\n2:2 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear\nburdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three\nthousand and six hundred to oversee them.\n\n2:3 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst\ndeal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an\nhouse to dwell therein, even so deal with me.\n\n2:4 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to\ndedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the\ncontinual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening,\non the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the\nLORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.\n\n2:5 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above\nall gods.\n\n2:6 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and\nheaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should\nbuild him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?  2:7 Send\nme now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in\nbrass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can\nskill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in\nJerusalem, whom David my father did provide.\n\n2:8 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of\nLebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in\nLebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, 2:9 Even\nto prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to\nbuild shall be wonderful great.\n\n2:10 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut\ntimber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand\nmeasures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty\nthousand baths of oil.\n\n2:11 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to\nSolomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee\nking over them.\n\n2:12 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made\nheaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued\nwith prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the\nLORD, and an house for his kingdom.\n\n2:13 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of\nHuram my father's, 2:14 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan,\nand his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in\nsilver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in\nblue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of\ngraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with\nthy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.\n\n2:15 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,\nwhich my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 2:16 And\nwe will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we\nwill bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry\nit up to Jerusalem.\n\n2:17 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of\nIsrael, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered\nthem; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three\nthousand and six hundred.\n\n2:18 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of\nburdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and\nthree thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.\n\n3:1 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in\nmount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the\nplace that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the\nJebusite.\n\n3:2 And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in\nthe fourth year of his reign.\n\n3:3 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the\nbuilding of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first\nmeasure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.\n\n3:4 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it\nwas according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the\nheight was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure\ngold.\n\n3:5 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid\nwith fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.\n\n3:6 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and\nthe gold was gold of Parvaim.\n\n3:7 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls\nthereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the\nwalls.\n\n3:8 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according\nto the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof\ntwenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six\nhundred talents.\n\n3:9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he\noverlaid the upper chambers with gold.\n\n3:10 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work,\nand overlaid them with gold.\n\n3:11 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing\nof the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house:\nand the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of\nthe other cherub.\n\n3:12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the\nwall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to\nthe wing of the other cherub.\n\n3:13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty\ncubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.\n\n3:14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine\nlinen, and wrought cherubims thereon.\n\n3:15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five\ncubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was\nfive cubits.\n\n3:16 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads\nof the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the\nchains.\n\n3:17 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right\nhand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the\nright hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.\n\n4:1 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length\nthereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the\nheight thereof.\n\n4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round\nin compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty\ncubits did compass it round about.\n\n4:3 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it\nround about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows\nof oxen were cast, when it was cast.\n\n4:4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and\nthree looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and\nthree looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,\nand all their hinder parts were inward.\n\n4:5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it\nlike the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it\nreceived and held three thousand baths.\n\n4:6 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five\non the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the\nburnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to\nwash in.\n\n4:7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and\nset them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.\n\n4:8 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on\nthe right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of\ngold.\n\n4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,\nand doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.\n\n4:10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over\nagainst the south.\n\n4:11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And\nHuram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the\nhouse of God; 4:12 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the\nchapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two\nwreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the\ntop of the pillars; 4:13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two\nwreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two\npommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.\n\n4:14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 4:15 One\nsea, and twelve oxen under it.\n\n4:16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their\ninstruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house\nof the LORD of bright brass.\n\n4:17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground\nbetween Succoth and Zeredathah.\n\n4:18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the\nweight of the brass could not be found out.\n\n4:19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God,\nthe golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;\n4:20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn\nafter the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 4:21 And the\nflowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that\nperfect gold; 4:22 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons,\nand the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner\ndoors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of\nthe temple, were of gold.\n\n5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was\nfinished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father\nhad dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments,\nput he among the treasures of the house of God.\n\n5:2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of\nthe tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto\nJerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the\ncity of David, which is Zion.\n\n5:3 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king\nin the feast which was in the seventh month.\n\n5:4 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the\nark.\n\n5:5 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,\nthese did the priests and the Levites bring up.\n\n5:6 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were\nassembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which\ncould not be told nor numbered for multitude.\n\n5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD\nunto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place,\neven under the wings of the cherubims: 5:8 For the cherubims spread\nforth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered\nthe ark and the staves thereof above.\n\n5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the\nstaves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not\nseen without. And there it is unto this day.\n\n5:10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put\ntherein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of\nIsrael, when they came out of Egypt.\n\n5:11 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy\nplace: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did\nnot then wait by course: 5:12 Also the Levites which were the singers,\nall of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their\nbrethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries\nand harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an\nhundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 5:13 It came even\nto pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound\nto be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up\ntheir voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick,\nand praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth\nfor ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house\nof the LORD; 5:14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by\nreason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of\nGod.\n\n6:1 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the\nthick darkness.\n\n6:2 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for\nthy dwelling for ever.\n\n6:3 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation\nof Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.\n\n6:4 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his\nhands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David,\nsaying, 6:5 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the\nland of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build\nan house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to\nbe a ruler over my people Israel: 6:6 But I have chosen Jerusalem,\nthat my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my\npeople Israel.\n\n6:7 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\n\n6:8 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine\nheart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in\nthine heart: 6:9 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but\nthy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the\nhouse for my name.\n\n6:10 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken:\nfor I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the\nthrone of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\n\n6:11 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the\nLORD, that he made with the children of Israel.\n\n6:12 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all\nthe congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: 6:13 For\nSolomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five\ncubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of\nthe court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees\nbefore all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands\ntoward heaven.\n\n6:14 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the\nheaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy\nunto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: 6:15\nThou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou\nhast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it\nwith thine hand, as it is this day.\n\n6:16 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David\nmy father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not\nfail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so\nthat thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou\nhast walked before me.\n\n6:17 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which\nthou hast spoken unto thy servant David.\n\n6:18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,\nheaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less\nthis house which I have built!  6:19 Have respect therefore to the\nprayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to\nhearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before\nthee: 6:20 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,\nupon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name\nthere; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward\nthis place.\n\n6:21 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of\nthy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou\nfrom thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest,\nforgive.\n\n6:22 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him\nto make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;\n6:23 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by\nrequiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and\nby justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his\nrighteousness.\n\n6:24 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,\nbecause they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess\nthy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;\n6:25 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy\npeople Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to\nthem and to their fathers.\n\n6:26 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they\nhave sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and\nconfess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict\nthem; 6:27 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy\nservants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the\ngood way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which\nthou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.\n\n6:28 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there\nbe blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies\nbesiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or\nwhatsoever sickness there be: 6:29 Then what prayer or what\nsupplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people\nIsrael, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and\nshall spread forth his hands in this house: 6:30 Then hear thou from\nheaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man\naccording unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only\nknowest the hearts of the children of men:) 6:31 That they may fear\nthee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou\ngavest unto our fathers.\n\n6:32 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people\nIsrael, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and\nthy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in\nthis house; 6:33 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy\ndwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to\nthee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear\nthee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I\nhave built is called by thy name.\n\n6:34 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that\nthou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which\nthou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; 6:35\nThen hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication,\nand maintain their cause.\n\n6:36 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth\nnot,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their\nenemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or\nnear; 6:37 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are\ncarried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their\ncaptivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt\nwickedly; 6:38 If they return to thee with all their heart and with\nall their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have\ncarried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest\nunto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and\ntoward the house which I have built for thy name: 6:39 Then hear thou\nfrom the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their\nsupplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which\nhave sinned against thee.\n\n6:40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let\nthine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.\n\n6:41 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,\nand the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed\nwith salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.\n\n6:42 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember\nthe mercies of David thy servant.\n\n7:1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down\nfrom heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and\nthe glory of the LORD filled the house.\n\n7:2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,\nbecause the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.\n\n7:3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,\nand the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with\ntheir faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and\npraised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for\never.\n\n7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the\nLORD.\n\n7:5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand\noxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all\nthe people dedicated the house of God.\n\n7:6 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with\ninstruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to\npraise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David\npraised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before\nthem, and all Israel stood.\n\n7:7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before\nthe house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the\nfat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had\nmade was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat\nofferings, and the fat.\n\n7:8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all\nIsrael with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of\nHamath unto the river of Egypt.\n\n7:9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept\nthe dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.\n\n7:10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent\nthe people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the\ngoodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to\nIsrael his people.\n\n7:11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's\nhouse: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of\nthe LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.\n\n7:12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I\nhave heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an\nhouse of sacrifice.\n\n7:13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the\nlocusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;\n7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble\nthemselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked\nways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and\nwill heal their land.\n\n7:15 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer\nthat is made in this place.\n\n7:16 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may\nbe there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there\nperpetually.\n\n7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father\nwalked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt\nobserve my statutes and my judgments; 7:18 Then will I stablish the\nthrone of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy\nfather, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.\n\n7:19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,\nwhich I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and\nworship them; 7:20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my\nland which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified\nfor my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a\nproverb and a byword among all nations.\n\n7:21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every\none that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done\nthus unto this land, and unto this house?  7:22 And it shall be\nanswered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which\nbrought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other\ngods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought\nall this evil upon them.\n\n8:1 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon\nhad built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 8:2 That the\ncities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and\ncaused the children of Israel to dwell there.\n\n8:3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.\n\n8:4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,\nwhich he built in Hamath.\n\n8:5 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,\nfenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 8:6 And Baalath, and all\nthe store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the\ncities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in\nJerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his\ndominion.\n\n8:7 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the\nAmorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,\nwhich were not of Israel, 8:8 But of their children, who were left\nafter them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them\ndid Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.\n\n8:9 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his\nwork; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and\ncaptains of his chariots and horsemen.\n\n8:10 And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two\nhundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.\n\n8:11 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of\nDavid unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife\nshall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the\nplaces are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.\n\n8:12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar\nof the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 8:13 Even after a\ncertain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of\nMoses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn\nfeasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened\nbread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.\n\n8:14 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the\ncourses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their\ncharges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of\nevery day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate:\nfor so had David the man of God commanded.\n\n8:15 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the\npriests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the\ntreasures.\n\n8:16 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the\nfoundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the\nhouse of the LORD was perfected.\n\n8:17 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in\nthe land of Edom.\n\n8:18 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and\nservants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the\nservants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty\ntalents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.\n\n9:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came\nto prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great\ncompany, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and\nprecious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with\nhim of all that was in her heart.\n\n9:2 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid\nfrom Solomon which he told her not.\n\n9:3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and\nthe house that he had built, 9:4 And the meat of his table, and the\nsitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and\ntheir apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent\nby which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more\nspirit in her.\n\n9:5 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in\nmine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: 9:6 Howbeit I believed\nnot their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold,\nthe one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou\nexceedest the fame that I heard.\n\n9:7 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand\ncontinually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.\n\n9:8 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee\non his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved\nIsrael, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over\nthem, to do judgment and justice.\n\n9:9 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and\nof spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any\nsuch spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.\n\n9:10 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,\nwhich brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious\nstones.\n\n9:11 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the\nLORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers:\nand there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.\n\n9:12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,\nwhatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king.\nSo she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.\n\n9:13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six\nhundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 9:14 Beside that which\nchapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and\ngovernors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.\n\n9:15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six\nhundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.\n\n9:16 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred\nshekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house\nof the forest of Lebanon.\n\n9:17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it\nwith pure gold.\n\n9:18 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,\nwhich were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the\nsitting place, and two lions standing by the stays: 9:19 And twelve\nlions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps.\nThere was not the like made in any kingdom.\n\n9:20 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and\nall the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure\ngold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the\ndays of Solomon.\n\n9:21 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:\nevery three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and\nsilver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\n\n9:22 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and\nwisdom.\n\n9:23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to\nhear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.\n\n9:24 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and\nvessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules,\na rate year by year.\n\n9:25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and\ntwelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and\nwith the king at Jerusalem.\n\n9:26 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the\nland of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.\n\n9:27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees\nmade he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.\n\n9:28 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all\nlands.\n\n9:29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not\nwritten in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of\nAhijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against\nJeroboam the son of Nebat?  9:30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over\nall Israel forty years.\n\n9:31 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city\nof David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.\n\n10:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come\nto make him king.\n\n10:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in\nEgypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard\nit, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.\n\n10:3 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and\nspake to Rehoboam, saying, 10:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now\ntherefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and\nhis heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.\n\n10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And\nthe people departed.\n\n10:6 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood\nbefore Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel\ngive ye me to return answer to this people?  10:7 And they spake unto\nhim, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and\nspeak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.\n\n10:8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took\ncounsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood\nbefore him.\n\n10:9 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return\nanswer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat\nthe yoke that thy father did put upon us?  10:10 And the young men\nthat were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou\nanswer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our\nyoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou\nsay unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's\nloins.\n\n10:11 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more\nto your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise\nyou with scorpions.\n\n10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third\nday, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.\n\n10:13 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook\nthe counsel of the old men, 10:14 And answered them after the advice\nof the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will\nadd thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise\nyou with scorpions.\n\n10:15 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of\nGod, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand\nof Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n\n10:16 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto\nthem, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in\nDavid?  and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to\nyour tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all\nIsrael went to their tents.\n\n10:17 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of\nJudah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\n\n10:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and\nthe children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king\nRehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to\nJerusalem.\n\n10:19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.\n\n11:1 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house\nof Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men,\nwhich were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the\nkingdom again to Rehoboam.\n\n11:2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,\n11:3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all\nIsrael in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 11:4 Thus saith the LORD, Ye\nshall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to\nhis house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of\nthe LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.\n\n11:5 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in\nJudah.\n\n11:6 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 11:7 And Bethzur,\nand Shoco, and Adullam, 11:8 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 11:9\nAnd Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 11:10 And Zorah, and Aijalon,\nand Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.\n\n11:11 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and\nstore of victual, and of oil and wine.\n\n11:12 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made\nthem exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.\n\n11:13 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted\nto him out of all their coasts.\n\n11:14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and\ncame to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them\noff from executing the priest's office unto the LORD: 11:15 And he\nordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for\nthe calves which he had made.\n\n11:16 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their\nhearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice\nunto the LORD God of their fathers.\n\n11:17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the\nson of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the\nway of David and Solomon.\n\n11:18 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son\nof David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;\n11:19 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.\n\n11:20 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which\nbare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.\n\n11:21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his\nwives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore\nconcubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore\ndaughters.)  11:22 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the\nchief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him\nking.\n\n11:23 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children\nthroughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced\ncity: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many\nwives.\n\n12:1 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,\nand had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all\nIsrael with him.\n\n12:2 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam\nShishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had\ntransgressed against the LORD, 12:3 With twelve hundred chariots, and\nthreescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that\ncame with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the\nEthiopians.\n\n12:4 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came\nto Jerusalem.\n\n12:5 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of\nJudah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak,\nand said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and\ntherefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.\n\n12:6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;\nand they said, The LORD is righteous.\n\n12:7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of\nthe LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;\ntherefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some\ndeliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by\nthe hand of Shishak.\n\n12:8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my\nservice, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.\n\n12:9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away\nthe treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the\nking's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold\nwhich Solomon had made.\n\n12:10 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and\ncommitted them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the\nentrance of the king's house.\n\n12:11 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard\ncame and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.\n\n12:12 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from\nhim, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah\nthings went well.\n\n12:13 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:\nfor Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and\nhe reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had\nchosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his\nmother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.\n\n12:14 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the\nLORD.\n\n12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written\nin the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning\ngenealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam\ncontinually.\n\n12:16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city\nof David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.\n\n13:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign\nover Judah.\n\n13:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was\nMichaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between\nAbijah and Jeroboam.\n\n13:3 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of\nwar, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the\nbattle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,\nbeing mighty men of valour.\n\n13:4 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount\nEphraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; 13:5 Ought\nye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over\nIsrael to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of\nsalt?  13:6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the\nson of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.\n\n13:7 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,\nand have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,\nwhen Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand\nthem.\n\n13:8 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand\nof the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with\nyour golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.\n\n13:9 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron,\nand the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the\nnations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself\nwith a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them\nthat are no gods.\n\n13:10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken\nhim; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of\nAaron, and the Levites wait upon their business: 13:11 And they burn\nunto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and\nsweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure\ntable; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn\nevery evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have\nforsaken him.\n\n13:12 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his\npriests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of\nIsrael, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye\nshall not prosper.\n\n13:13 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so\nthey were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.\n\n13:14 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and\nbehind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the\ntrumpets.\n\n13:15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah\nshouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel\nbefore Abijah and Judah.\n\n13:16 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered\nthem into their hand.\n\n13:17 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so\nthere fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.\n\n13:18 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and\nthe children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God\nof their fathers.\n\n13:19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,\nBethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof,\nand Ephraim with the towns thereof.\n\n13:20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of\nAbijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.\n\n13:21 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat\ntwenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.\n\n13:22 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his\nsayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.\n\n14:1 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city\nof David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land\nwas quiet ten years.\n\n14:2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD\nhis God: 14:3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the\nhigh places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: 14:4\nAnd commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do\nthe law and the commandment.\n\n14:5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places\nand the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.\n\n14:6 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and\nhe had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.\n\n14:7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make\nabout them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet\nbefore us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought\nhim, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and\nprospered.\n\n14:8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of\nJudah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields\nand drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were\nmighty men of valour.\n\n14:9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host\nof a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto\nMareshah.\n\n14:10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array\nin the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.\n\n14:11 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is\nnothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have\nno power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy\nname we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no\nman prevail against thee.\n\n14:12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;\nand the Ethiopians fled.\n\n14:13 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto\nGerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover\nthemselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his\nhost; and they carried away very much spoil.\n\n14:14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of\nthe LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there\nwas exceeding much spoil in them.\n\n14:15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and\ncamels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.\n\n15:1 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 15:2 And\nhe went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all\nJudah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if\nye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will\nforsake you.\n\n15:3 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and\nwithout a teaching priest, and without law.\n\n15:4 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of\nIsrael, and sought him, he was found of them.\n\n15:5 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor\nto him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants\nof the countries.\n\n15:6 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did\nvex them with all adversity.\n\n15:7 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your\nwork shall be rewarded.\n\n15:8 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the\nprophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all\nthe land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had\ntaken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was\nbefore the porch of the LORD.\n\n15:9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with\nthem out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to\nhim out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God\nwas with him.\n\n15:10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third\nmonth, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.\n\n15:11 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which\nthey had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.\n\n15:12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their\nfathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 15:13 That\nwhosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to\ndeath, whether small or great, whether man or woman.\n\n15:14 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with\nshouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.\n\n15:15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all\ntheir heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found\nof them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.\n\n15:16 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he\nremoved her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove:\nand Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook\nKidron.\n\n15:17 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:\nnevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.\n\n15:18 And he brought into the house of God the things that his father\nhad dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold,\nand vessels.\n\n15:19 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of\nthe reign of Asa.\n\n16:1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of\nIsrael came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he\nmight let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.\n\n16:2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the\nhouse of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king\nof Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 16:3 There is a league\nbetween me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father:\nbehold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with\nBaasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.\n\n16:4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of\nhis armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan,\nand Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.\n\n16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off\nbuilding of Ramah, and let his work cease.\n\n16:6 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the\nstones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was\nbuilding; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.\n\n16:7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and\nsaid unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not\nrelied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria\nescaped out of thine hand.\n\n16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very\nmany chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD,\nhe delivered them into thine hand.\n\n16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole\nearth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is\nperfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from\nhenceforth thou shalt have wars.\n\n16:10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house;\nfor he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed\nsome of the people the same time.\n\n16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are\nwritten in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\n\n16:12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased\nin his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease\nhe sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.\n\n16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth\nyear of his reign.\n\n16:14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for\nhimself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled\nwith sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the\napothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.\n\n17:1 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened\nhimself against Israel.\n\n17:2 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set\ngarrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which\nAsa his father had taken.\n\n17:3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first\nways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; 17:4 But sought\nto the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not\nafter the doings of Israel.\n\n17:5 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all\nJudah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in\nabundance.\n\n17:6 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he\ntook away the high places and groves out of Judah.\n\n17:7 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even\nto Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to\nMichaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.\n\n17:8 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and\nZebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah,\nand Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and\nJehoram, priests.\n\n17:9 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD\nwith them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and\ntaught the people.\n\n17:10 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands\nthat were round about Judah, so that they made no war against\nJehoshaphat.\n\n17:11 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and\ntribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand\nand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.\n\n17:12 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah\ncastles, and cities of store.\n\n17:13 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of\nwar, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.\n\n17:14 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of\ntheir fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief,\nand with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.\n\n17:15 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two\nhundred and fourscore thousand.\n\n17:16 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly\noffered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand\nmighty men of valour.\n\n17:17 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him\narmed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.\n\n17:18 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and\nfourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.\n\n17:19 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the\nfenced cities throughout all Judah.\n\n18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined\naffinity with Ahab.\n\n18:2 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab\nkilled sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he\nhad with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.\n\n18:3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt\nthou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou\nart, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.\n\n18:4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray\nthee, at the word of the LORD to day.\n\n18:5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four\nhundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to\nbattle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver\nit into the king's hand.\n\n18:6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD\nbesides, that we might enquire of him?  18:7 And the king of Israel\nsaid unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of\nthe LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but\nalways evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat\nsaid, Let not the king say so.\n\n18:8 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,\nFetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.\n\n18:9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either\nof them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void\nplace at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets\nprophesied before them.\n\n18:10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,\nand said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until\nthey be consumed.\n\n18:11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to\nRamothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand\nof the king.\n\n18:12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,\nsaying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king\nwith one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of\ntheir's, and speak thou good.\n\n18:13 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,\nthat will I speak.\n\n18:14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,\nMicaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?\nAnd he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into\nyour hand.\n\n18:15 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee\nthat thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?\n18:16 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,\nas sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no\nmaster; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.\n\n18:17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee\nthat he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?  18:18 Again he\nsaid, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon\nhis throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and\non his left.\n\n18:19 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he\nmay go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this\nmanner, and another saying after that manner.\n\n18:20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and\nsaid, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  18:21\nAnd he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all\nhis prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt\nalso prevail: go out, and do even so.\n\n18:22 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the\nmouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against\nthee.\n\n18:23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah\nupon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from\nme to speak unto thee?  18:24 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see\non that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.\n\n18:25 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him\nback to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;\n18:26 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and\nfeed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until\nI return in peace.\n\n18:27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath\nnot the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.\n\n18:28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up\nto Ramothgilead.\n\n18:29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise\nmyself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the\nking of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.\n\n18:30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots\nthat were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save\nonly with the king of Israel.\n\n18:31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw\nJehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they\ncompassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD\nhelped him; and God moved them to depart from him.\n\n18:32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots\nperceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again\nfrom pursuing him.\n\n18:33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of\nIsrael between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his\nchariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the\nhost; for I am wounded.\n\n18:34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel\nstayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even:\nand about the time of the sun going down he died.\n\n19:1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace\nto Jerusalem.\n\n19:2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and\nsaid to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love\nthem that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the\nLORD.\n\n19:3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou\nhast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine\nheart to seek God.\n\n19:4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through\nthe people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto\nthe LORD God of their fathers.\n\n19:5 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of\nJudah, city by city, 19:6 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye\ndo: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the\njudgment.\n\n19:7 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and\ndo it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of\npersons, nor taking of gifts.\n\n19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of\nthe priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the\njudgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to\nJerusalem.\n\n19:9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the\nLORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.\n\n19:10 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that\ndwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and\ncommandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they\ntrespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon\nyour brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.\n\n19:11 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters\nof the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house\nof Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be\nofficers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the\ngood.\n\n20:1 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and\nthe children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came\nagainst Jehoshaphat to battle.\n\n20:2 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh\na great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria;\nand, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.\n\n20:3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and\nproclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.\n\n20:4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD:\neven out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.\n\n20:5 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,\nin the house of the LORD, before the new court, 20:6 And said, O LORD\nGod of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou\nover all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not\npower and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?  20:7 Art not\nthou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before\nthy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for\never?  20:8 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary\ntherein for thy name, saying, 20:9 If, when evil cometh upon us, as\nthe sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this\nhouse, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry\nunto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.\n\n20:10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,\nwhom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the\nland of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;\n20:11 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy\npossession, which thou hast given us to inherit.\n\n20:12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might\nagainst this great company that cometh against us; neither know we\nwhat to do: but our eyes are upon thee.\n\n20:13 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,\ntheir wives, and their children.\n\n20:14 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the\nson of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph,\ncame the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 20:15\nAnd he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nand thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid\nnor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not\nyours, but God's.\n\n20:16 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the\ncliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before\nthe wilderness of Jeruel.\n\n20:17 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand\nye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and\nJerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them:\nfor the LORD will be with you.\n\n20:18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and\nall Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD,\nworshipping the LORD.\n\n20:19 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the\nchildren of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel\nwith a loud voice on high.\n\n20:20 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the\nwilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and\nsaid, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in\nthe LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets,\nso shall ye prosper.\n\n20:21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers\nunto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they\nwent out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy\nendureth for ever.\n\n20:22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set\nambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which\nwere come against Judah; and they were smitten.\n\n20:23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the\ninhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when\nthey had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to\ndestroy another.\n\n20:24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,\nthey looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies\nfallen to the earth, and none escaped.\n\n20:25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil\nof them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead\nbodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves,\nmore than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering\nof the spoil, it was so much.\n\n20:26 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of\nBerachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the\nsame place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.\n\n20:27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and\nJehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with\njoy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.\n\n20:28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and\ntrumpets unto the house of the LORD.\n\n20:29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries,\nwhen they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of\nIsrael.\n\n20:30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest\nround about.\n\n20:31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years\nold when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in\nJerusalem.\n\nAnd his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\n\n20:32 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not\nfrom it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.\n\n20:33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the\npeople had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.\n\n20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,\nthey are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is\nmentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.\n\n20:35 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with\nAhaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 20:36 And he joined\nhimself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the\nships in Eziongaber.\n\n20:37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against\nJehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,\nthe LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they\nwere not able to go to Tarshish.\n\n21:1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\nfathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his\nstead.\n\n21:2 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,\nand Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these\nwere the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.\n\n21:3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,\nand of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom\ngave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.\n\n21:4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he\nstrengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and\ndivers also of the princes of Israel.\n\n21:5 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and\nhe reigned eight years in Jerusalem.\n\n21:6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the\nhouse of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought\nthat which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.\n\n21:7 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of\nthe covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a\nlight to him and to his sons for ever.\n\n21:8 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of\nJudah, and made themselves a king.\n\n21:9 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots\nwith him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which\ncompassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.\n\n21:10 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this\nday.\n\nThe same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he\nhad forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.\n\n21:11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and\ncaused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and\ncompelled Judah thereto.\n\n21:12 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,\nThus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not\nwalked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa\nking of Judah, 21:13 But hast walked in the way of the kings of\nIsrael, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a\nwhoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast\nslain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than\nthyself: 21:14 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy\npeople, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: 21:15 And\nthou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy\nbowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.\n\n21:16 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the\nPhilistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: 21:17\nAnd they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all\nthe substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also,\nand his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz,\nthe youngest of his sons.\n\n21:18 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an\nincurable disease.\n\n21:19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of\ntwo years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died\nof sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the\nburning of his fathers.\n\n21:20 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he\nreigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.\nHowbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the\nsepulchres of the kings.\n\n22:1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son\nking in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to\nthe camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king\nof Judah reigned.\n\n22:2 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and\nhe reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah\nthe daughter of Omri.\n\n22:3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother\nwas his counsellor to do wickedly.\n\n22:4 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of\nAhab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to\nhis destruction.\n\n22:5 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son\nof Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at\nRamothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.\n\n22:6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds\nwhich were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of\nSyria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see\nJehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.\n\n22:7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for\nwhen he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of\nNimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.\n\n22:8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon\nthe house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the\nbrethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.\n\n22:9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in\nSamaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they\nburied him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who\nsought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no\npower to keep still the kingdom.\n\n22:10 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was\ndead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of\nJudah.\n\n22:11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son\nof Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain,\nand put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the\ndaughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she\nwas the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew\nhim not.\n\n22:12 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and\nAthaliah reigned over the land.\n\n23:1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took\nthe captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the\nson of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of\nAdaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.\n\n23:2 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all\nthe cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they\ncame to Jerusalem.\n\n23:3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the\nhouse of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall\nreign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.\n\n23:4 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering\non the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of\nthe doors; 23:5 And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a\nthird part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be\nin the courts of the house of the LORD.\n\n23:6 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests,\nand they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are\nholy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.\n\n23:7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man\nwith his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the\nhouse, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he\ncometh in, and when he goeth out.\n\n23:8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that\nJehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that\nwere to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the\nsabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.\n\n23:9 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of\nhundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king\nDavid's, which were in the house of God.\n\n23:10 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his\nhand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the\ntemple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.\n\n23:11 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the\ncrown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and\nhis sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.\n\n23:12 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and\npraising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:\n23:13 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the\nentering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the\npeople of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the\nsingers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.\nThen Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.\n\n23:14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds\nthat were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the\nranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For\nthe priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.\n\n23:15 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering\nof the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.\n\n23:16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the\npeople, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.\n\n23:17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it\ndown, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan\nthe priest of Baal before the altars.\n\n23:18 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by\nthe hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the\nhouse of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is\nwritten in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it\nwas ordained by David.\n\n23:19 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,\nthat none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.\n\n23:20 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the\ngovernors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought\ndown the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the\nhigh gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of\nthe kingdom.\n\n23:21 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,\nafter that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.\n\n24:1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\nforty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of\nBeersheba.\n\n24:2 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all\nthe days of Jehoiada the priest.\n\n24:3 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and\ndaughters.\n\n24:4 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair\nthe house of the LORD.\n\n24:5 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to\nthem, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money\nto repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye\nhasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.\n\n24:6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,\nWhy hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and\nout of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses\nthe servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the\ntabernacle of witness?  24:7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked\nwoman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated\nthings of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.\n\n24:8 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it\nwithout at the gate of the house of the LORD.\n\n24:9 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to\nbring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid\nupon Israel in the wilderness.\n\n24:10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,\nand cast into the chest, until they had made an end.\n\n24:11 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought\nunto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw\nthat there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's\nofficer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his\nplace again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in\nabundance.\n\n24:12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the\nservice of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to\nrepair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass\nto mend the house of the LORD.\n\n24:13 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and\nthey set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.\n\n24:14 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the\nmoney before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the\nhouse of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and\nspoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt\nofferings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of\nJehoiada.\n\n24:15 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an\nhundred and thirty years old was he when he died.\n\n24:16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,\nbecause he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his\nhouse.\n\n24:17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and\nmade obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.\n\n24:18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and\nserved groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for\nthis their trespass.\n\n24:19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD;\nand they testified against them: but they would not give ear.\n\n24:20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada\nthe priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus\nsaith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye\ncannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also\nforsaken you.\n\n24:21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at\nthe commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.\n\n24:22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada\nhis father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he\nsaid, The LORD look upon it, and require it.\n\n24:23 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of\nSyria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and\ndestroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and\nsent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.\n\n24:24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,\nand the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they\nhad forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment\nagainst Joash.\n\n24:25 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in\ngreat diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood\nof the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he\ndied: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him\nnot in the sepulchres of the kings.\n\n24:26 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of\nShimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.\n\n24:27 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid\nupon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are\nwritten in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son\nreigned in his stead.\n\n25:1 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and\nhe reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name\nwas Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.\n\n25:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not\nwith a perfect heart.\n\n25:3 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,\nthat he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.\n\n25:4 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the\nlaw in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The\nfathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die\nfor the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.\n\n25:5 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains\nover thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of\ntheir fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them\nfrom twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand\nchoice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and\nshield.\n\n25:6 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of\nIsrael for an hundred talents of silver.\n\n25:7 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the\narmy of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit,\nwith all the children of Ephraim.\n\n25:8 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall\nmake thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to\ncast down.\n\n25:9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the\nhundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man\nof God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.\n\n25:10 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to\nhim out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was\ngreatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.\n\n25:11 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and\nwent to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten\nthousand.\n\n25:12 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah\ncarry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and\ncast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in\npieces.\n\n25:13 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they\nshould not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from\nSamaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and\ntook much spoil.\n\n25:14 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the\nslaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of\nSeir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before\nthem, and burned incense unto them.\n\n25:15 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and\nhe sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought\nafter the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people\nout of thine hand?  25:16 And it came to pass, as he talked with him,\nthat the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel?\nforbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and\nsaid, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou\nhast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.\n\n25:17 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the\nson of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us\nsee one another in the face.\n\n25:18 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,\nThe thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,\nsaying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a\nwild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.\n\n25:19 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart\nlifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle\nto thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with\nthee?  25:20 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he\nmight deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought\nafter the gods of Edom.\n\n25:21 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in\nthe face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which\nbelongeth to Judah.\n\n25:22 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled\nevery man to his tent.\n\n25:23 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son\nof Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to\nJerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of\nEphraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.\n\n25:24 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels\nthat were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures\nof the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.\n\n25:25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death\nof Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.\n\n25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are\nthey not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?  25:27\nNow after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD\nthey made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to\nLachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.\n\n25:28 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his\nfathers in the city of Judah.\n\n26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years\nold, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.\n\n26:2 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king\nslept with his fathers.\n\n26:3 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he\nreigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was\nJecoliah of Jerusalem.\n\n26:4 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that his father Amaziah did.\n\n26:5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding\nin the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him\nto prosper.\n\n26:6 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake\ndown the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod,\nand built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.\n\n26:7 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the\nArabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.\n\n26:8 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread\nabroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself\nexceedingly.\n\n26:9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and\nat the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified\nthem.\n\n26:10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for\nhe had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains:\nhusbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel:\nfor he loved husbandry.\n\n26:11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to\nwar by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of\nJeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah,\none of the king's captains.\n\n26:12 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men\nof valour were two thousand and six hundred.\n\n26:13 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and\nseven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to\nhelp the king against the enemy.\n\n26:14 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,\nand spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast\nstones.\n\n26:15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be\non the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones\nwithal.\n\nAnd his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till\nhe was strong.\n\n26:16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his\ndestruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went\ninto the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.\n\n26:17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore\npriests of the LORD, that were valiant men: 26:18 And they withstood\nUzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee,\nUzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of\nAaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary;\nfor thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from\nthe LORD God.\n\n26:19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn\nincense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even\nrose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD,\nfrom beside the incense altar.\n\n26:20 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon\nhim, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him\nout from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD\nhad smitten him.\n\n26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and\ndwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the\nhouse of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house,\njudging the people of the land.\n\n26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah\nthe prophet, the son of Amoz, write.\n\n26:23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his\nfathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for\nthey said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.\n\n27:1 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and\nhe reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was\nJerushah, the daughter of Zadok.\n\n27:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not\ninto the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.\n\n27:3 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall\nof Ophel he built much.\n\n27:4 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the\nforests he built castles and towers.\n\n27:5 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed\nagainst them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an\nhundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten\nthousand of barley.
