And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the\nwaters.\n\n1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n\n1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light\nfrom the darkness.\n\n1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.\nAnd the evening and the morning were the first day.\n\n1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,\nand let it divide the waters from the waters.\n\n1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were\nunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:\nand it was so.\n\n1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the\nmorning were the second day.\n\n1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together\nunto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n\n1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of\nthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding\nseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is\nin itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\n\n1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after\nhis kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n\n1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven\nto divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for\nseasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in\nthe firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was\nso.\n\n1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,\nand the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\n\n1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light\nupon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and\nto divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n\n1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving\ncreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the\nopen firmament of heaven.\n\n1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that\nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,\nand every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill\nthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n\n1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n\n1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after\nhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his\nkind: and it was so.\n\n1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle\nafter their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:\nand let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl\nof the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over\nevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\n1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created\nhe him; male and female created he them.\n\n1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion\nover the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every\nliving thing that moveth upon the earth.\n\n1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,\nwhich is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which\nis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n\n1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,\nand to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is\nlife, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n\n1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was\nvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\n\n2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of\nthem.\n\n2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and\nhe rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n\n2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that\nin it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\n\n2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when\nthey were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the\nheavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,\nand every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not\ncaused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the\nground.\n\n2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole\nface of the ground.\n\n2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living\nsoul.\n\n2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he\nput the man whom he had formed.\n\n2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is\npleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the\nmidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n\n2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence\nit was parted, and became into four heads.\n\n2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the\nwhole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that\nland is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n\n2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that\ncompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\n\n2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which\ngoeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\n\n2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of\nEden to dress it and to keep it.\n\n2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the\ngarden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge\nof good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou\neatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n\n2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be\nalone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n\n2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the\nfield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see\nwhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living\ncreature, that was the name thereof.\n\n2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,\nand to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an\nhelp meet for him.\n\n2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he\nslept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead\nthereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made\nhe a woman, and brought her unto the man.\n\n2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my\nflesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n\n2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall\ncleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n\n2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not\nashamed.\n\n3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which\nthe LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,\nYe shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said\nunto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\n3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,\nGod hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest\nye die.\n\n3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5\nFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall\nbe opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n\n3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that\nit was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one\nwise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto\nher husband with her; and he did eat.\n\n3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they\nwere naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves\naprons.\n\n3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in\nthe cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the\npresence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.\n\n3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art\nthou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was\nafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n\n3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten\nof the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\n3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she\ngave me of the tree, and I did eat.\n\n3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast\ndone? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n\n3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done\nthis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the\nfield; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the\ndays of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the\nwoman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,\nand thou shalt bruise his heel.\n\n3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and\nthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy\ndesire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n\n3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice\nof thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,\nsaying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;\nin sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns\nalso and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the\nherb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,\ntill thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\n\n3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother\nof all living.\n\n3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of\nskins, and clothed them.\n\n3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to\nknow good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also\nof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the\nLORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground\nfrom whence he was taken.\n\n3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden\nof Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep\nthe way of the tree of life.\n\n4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and\nsaid, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\n\n4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of\nsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n\n4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the\nfruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.\n\n4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of\nthe fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his\noffering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.\nAnd Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n\n4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy\ncountenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be\naccepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto\nthee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\n\n4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when\nthey were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,\nand slew him.\n\n4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he\nsaid, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What\nhast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from\nthe ground.\n\n4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her\nmouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou\ntillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her\nstrength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\n\n4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can\nbear.\n\n4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the\nearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and\na vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one\nthat findeth me shall slay me.\n\n4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,\nvengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark\nupon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n\n4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the\nland of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n\n4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he\nbuilded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his\nson, Enoch.\n\n4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and\nMehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n\n4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,\nand the name of the other Zillah.\n\n4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,\nand of such as have cattle.\n\n4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such\nas handle the harp and organ.\n\n4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every\nartificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n\n4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;\nye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to\nmy wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\n\n4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and\nsevenfold.\n\n4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his\nname Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead\nof Abel, whom Cain slew.\n\n4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his\nname Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.\n\n5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God\ncreated man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female\ncreated he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the\nday when they were created.\n\n5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his\nown likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 And\nthe days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years:\nand he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived\nwere nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\n\n5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And\nSeth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and\nbegat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine\nhundred and twelve years: and he died.\n\n5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived\nafter he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons\nand daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and\nfive years: and he died.\n\n5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And\nCainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years,\nand begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were\nnine hundred and ten years: and he died.\n\n5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16\nAnd Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of\nMahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\n\n5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat\nEnoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,\nand begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine\nhundred sixty and two years: and he died.\n\n5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22\nAnd Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch\nwere three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with\nGod: and he was not; for God took him.\n\n5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat\nLamech.\n\n5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty\nand two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of\nMethuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\n\n5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a\nson: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort\nus concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground\nwhich the LORD hath cursed.\n\n5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech\nwere seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.\n\n5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,\nand Japheth.\n\n6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the\nearth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw\nthe daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of\nall which they chose.\n\n6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for\nthat he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty\nyears.\n\n6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,\nwhen the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare\nchildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of\nrenown.\n\n6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and\nthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\ncontinually.\n\n6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it\ngrieved him at his heart.\n\n6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the\nface of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and\nthe fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\n\n6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n\n6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect\nin his generations, and Noah walked with God.\n\n6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\n6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled\nwith violence.\n\n6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for\nall flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n\n6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;\nfor the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I\nwill destroy them with the earth.\n\n6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the\nark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\n\n6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length\nof the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty\ncubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n\n6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou\nfinish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side\nthereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n\n6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the\nearth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under\nheaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\n\n6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come\ninto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives\nwith thee.\n\n6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt\nthou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be\nmale and female.\n\n6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of\nevery creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort\nshall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\n\n6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt\ngather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n\n6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did\nhe.\n\n7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the\nark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.\n\n7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male\nand his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and\nhis female.\n\n7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to\nkeep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.\n\n7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth\nforty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have\nmade will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\n\n7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.\n\n7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was\nupon the earth.\n\n7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives\nwith him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n\n7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,\nand of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two\nand two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had\ncommanded Noah.\n\n7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the\nflood were upon the earth.\n\n7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,\nthe seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains\nof the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n\n7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n\n7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,\nthe sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons\nwith them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind,\nand all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,\nevery bird of every sort.\n\n7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all\nflesh, wherein is the breath of life.\n\n7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as\nGod had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\n\n7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters\nincreased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.\n\n7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the\nearth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.\n\n7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the\nhigh hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.\n\n7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains\nwere covered.\n\n7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and\nof cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth\nupon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the\nbreath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.\n\n7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face\nof the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the\nfowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah\nonly remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\n\n7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty\ndays.\n\n8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the\ncattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over\nthe earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep\nand the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was\nrestrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth\ncontinually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the\nwaters were abated.\n\n8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of\nthe month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n\n8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the\ntenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the\nmountains seen.\n\n8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the\nwindow of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,\nwhich went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off\nthe earth.\n\n8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were\nabated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest\nfor the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for\nthe waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his\nhand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.\n\n8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the\ndove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;\nand, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that\nthe waters were abated from off the earth.\n\n8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;\nwhich returned not again unto him any more.\n\n8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the\nfirst month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from\noff the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,\nand, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\n\n8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the\nmonth, was the earth dried.\n\n8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,\nand thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n\n8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of\nall flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing\nthat creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the\nearth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.\n\n8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'\nwives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every\nfowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went\nforth out of the ark.\n\n8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean\nbeast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the\naltar.\n\n8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his\nheart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for\nthe imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I\nagain smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\n\n8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and\nheat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n\n9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be\nfruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n\n9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast\nof the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth\nupon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are\nthey delivered.\n\n9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the\ngreen herb have I given you all things.\n\n9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall\nye not eat.\n\n9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of\nevery beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of\nevery man's brother will I require the life of man.\n\n9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in\nthe image of God made he man.\n\n9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in\nthe earth, and multiply therein.\n\n9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And\nI, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after\nyou; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the\nfowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from\nall that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\n\n9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all\nflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall\nthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\n\n9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make\nbetween me and you and every living creature that is with you, for\nperpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall\nbe for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\n\n9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,\nthat the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my\ncovenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all\nflesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all\nflesh.\n\n9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that\nI may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living\ncreature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\n\n9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which\nI have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n\n9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and\nHam, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\n\n9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth\noverspread.\n\n9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\n9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered\nwithin his tent.\n\n9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,\nand told his two brethren without.\n\n9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their\nshoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their\nfather; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's\nnakedness.\n\n9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had\ndone unto him.\n\n9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be\nunto his brethren.\n\n9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be\nhis servant.\n\n9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of\nShem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n\n9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n\n9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and\nhe died.\n\n10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and\nJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\n\n10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and\nTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n\n10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n\n10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and\nDodanim.\n\n10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;\nevery one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n\n10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\n\n10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,\nand Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.\n\n10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n\n10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,\nEven as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\n\n10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and\nAccad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n\n10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the\ncity Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:\nthe same is a great city.\n\n10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and\nCaphtorim.\n\n10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the\nJebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,\nand the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the\nZemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the\nCanaanites spread abroad.\n\n10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest\nto Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and\nAdmah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.\n\n10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their\ntongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\n\n10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the\nbrother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.\n\n10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,\nand Aram.\n\n10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n\n10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.\n\n10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for\nin his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.\n\n10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and\nJerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and\nAbimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these\nwere the sons of Joktan.\n\n10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a\nmount of the east.\n\n10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their\ntongues, in their lands, after their nations.\n\n10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their\ngenerations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided\nin the earth after the flood.\n\n11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\n\n11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they\nfound a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\n\n11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn\nthem thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for\nmorter.\n\n11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose\ntop may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be\nscattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\n\n11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the\nchildren of men builded.\n\n11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all\none language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be\nrestrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n\n11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that\nthey may not understand one another's speech.\n\n11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of\nall the earth: and they left off to build the city.\n\n11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did\nthere confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the\nLORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\n\n11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years\nold, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem\nlived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n\n11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13\nAnd Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,\nand begat sons and daughters.\n\n11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah\nlived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n\n11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And\nEber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and\nbegat sons and daughters.\n\n11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg\nlived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n\n11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And\nReu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n\n11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug\nlived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n\n11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25\nAnd Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,\nand begat sons and daughters.\n\n11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and\nHaran.\n\n11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,\nNahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.\n\n11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his\nnativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\n\n11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife\nwas Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of\nHaran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.\n\n11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n\n11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's\nson, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they\nwent forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of\nCanaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.\n\n11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah\ndied in Haran.\n\n12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,\nand from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I\nwill shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I\nwill bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a\nblessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him\nthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be\nblessed.\n\n12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went\nwith him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed\nout of Haran.\n\n12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all\ntheir substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had\ngotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;\nand into the land of Canaan they came.\n\n12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto\nthe plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n\n12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I\ngive this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who\nappeared unto him.\n\n12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,\nand pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:\nand there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name\nof the LORD.\n\n12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\n\n12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into\nEgypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.\n\n12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,\nthat he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a\nfair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when\nthe Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:\nand they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n\n12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with\nme for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\n\n12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the\nEgyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\n\n12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before\nPharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.\n\n12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and\noxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,\nand camels.\n\n12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues\nbecause of Sarai Abram's wife.\n\n12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast\ndone unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19\nWhy saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to\nwife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\n\n12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him\naway, and his wife, and all that he had.\n\n13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he\nhad, and Lot with him, into the south.\n\n13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n\n13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto\nthe place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and\nHai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the\nfirst: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\n\n13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and\ntents.\n\n13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell\ntogether: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell\ntogether.\n\n13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and\nthe herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite\ndwelled then in the land.\n\n13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,\nbetween me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be\nbrethren.\n\n13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,\nfrom me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;\nor if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\n\n13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,\nthat it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom\nand Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,\nas thou comest unto Zoar.\n\n13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed\neast: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n\n13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the\ncities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\n\n13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD\nexceedingly.\n\n13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from\nhim, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art\nnorthward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all\nthe land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for\never.\n\n13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a\nman can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be\nnumbered.\n\n13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the\nbreadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.\n\n13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of\nMamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.\n\n14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,\nArioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of\nnations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with\nBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of\nZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\n\n14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is\nthe salt sea.\n\n14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year\nthey rebelled.\n\n14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that\nwere with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the\nZuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the\nHorites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n\n14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and\nsmote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that\ndwelt in Hazezontamar.\n\n14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,\nand the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela\n(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of\nSiddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king\nof nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;\nfour kings with five.\n\n14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of\nSodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled\nto the mountain.\n\n14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their\nvictuals, and went their way.\n\n14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,\nand his goods, and departed.\n\n14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;\nfor he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and\nbrother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.\n\n14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he\narmed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and\neighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.\n\n14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by\nnight, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the\nleft hand of Damascus.\n\n14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his\nbrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\n\n14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from\nthe slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at\nthe valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.\n\n14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and\nhe was the priest of the most high God.\n\n14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high\nGod, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most high\nGod, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him\ntithes of all.\n\n14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and\ntake the goods to thyself.\n\n14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand\nunto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,\n14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and\nthat I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,\nI have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men have\neaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,\nand Mamre; let them take their portion.\n\n15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a\nvision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding\ngreat reward.\n\n15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go\nchildless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?\n15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,\none born in my house is mine heir.\n\n15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This\nshall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own\nbowels shall be thine heir.\n\n15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward\nheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he\nsaid unto him, So shall thy seed be.\n\n15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for\nrighteousness.\n\n15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur\nof the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n\n15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit\nit?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,\nand a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a\nturtledove, and a young pigeon.\n\n15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,\nand laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\n\n15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them\naway.\n\n15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;\nand, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n\n15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be\na stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and\nthey shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that\nnation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they\ncome out with great substance.\n\n15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried\nin a good old age.\n\n15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for\nthe iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\n\n15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was\ndark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between\nthose pieces.\n\n15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,\nUnto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the\ngreat river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the\nKenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the\nPerizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the\nCanaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\n\n16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an\nhandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n\n16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained\nme from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may\nobtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n\n16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after\nAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her\nhusband Abram to be his wife.\n\n16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw\nthat she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n\n16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my\nmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was\ndespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.\n\n16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do\nto her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she\nfled from her face.\n\n16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the\nwilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n\n16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither\nwilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n\n16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,\nand submit thyself under her hands.\n\n16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy\nseed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n\n16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with\nchild and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because\nthe LORD hath heard thy affliction.\n\n16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,\nand every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence\nof all his brethren.\n\n16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou\nGod seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that\nseeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,\nit is between Kadesh and Bered.\n\n16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,\nwhich Hagar bare, Ishmael.\n\n16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare\nIshmael to Abram.\n\n17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared\nto Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,\nand be thou perfect.\n\n17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will\nmultiply thee exceedingly.\n\n17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4\nAs for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a\nfather of many nations.\n\n17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name\nshall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.\n\n17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations\nof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\n\n17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed\nafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a\nGod unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\n\n17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land\nwherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an\neverlasting possession; and I will be their God.\n\n17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,\nthou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.\n\n17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and\nthy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.\n\n17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall\nbe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.\n\n17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,\nevery man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or\nbought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.\n\n17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy\nmoney, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your\nflesh for an everlasting covenant.\n\n17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is\nnot circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath\nbroken my covenant.\n\n17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not\ncall her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n\n17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I\nwill bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people\nshall be of her.\n\n17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his\nheart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?\nand shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham\nsaid unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And God\nsaid, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call\nhis name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an\neverlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.\n\n17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed\nhim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;\ntwelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\n\n17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall\nbear unto thee at this set time in the next year.\n\n17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n\n17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his\nhouse, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the\nmen of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in\nthe selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\n\n17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n\n17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n\n17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his\nson.\n\n17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with\nmoney of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\n\n18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat\nin the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes\nand looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he\nran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the\nground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy\nsight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little\nwater, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves\nunder the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort\nye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come\nto your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n\n18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make\nready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes\nupon the hearth.\n\n18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,\nand gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n\n18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,\nand set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they\ndid eat.\n\n18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,\nBehold, in the tent.\n\n18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the\ntime of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah\nheard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n\n18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it\nceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n\n18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed\nold shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD\nsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a\nsurety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard for\nthe LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to\nthe time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n\n18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.\nAnd he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n\n18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and\nAbraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n\n18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I\ndo; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty\nnation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his\nhousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do\njustice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which\nhe hath spoken of him.\n\n18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is\ngreat, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down\nnow, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of\nit, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\n\n18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward\nSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n\n18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the\nrighteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fifty\nrighteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the\nplace for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be far\nfrom thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the\nwicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far\nfrom thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 And\nthe LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,\nthen I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n\n18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me\nto speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28\nPeradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou\ndestroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there\nforty and five, I will not destroy it.\n\n18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there\nshall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's\nsake.\n\n18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will\nspeak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I\nwill not do it, if I find thirty there.\n\n18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the\nLORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I\nwill not destroy it for twenty's sake.\n\n18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet\nbut this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I\nwill not destroy it for ten's sake.\n\n18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with\nAbraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n\n19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the\ngate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed\nhimself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,\nmy lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry\nall night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on\nyour ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all\nnight.\n\n19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,\nand entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake\nunleavened bread, and they did eat.\n\n19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of\nSodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people\nfrom every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,\nWhere are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out\nunto us, that we may know them.\n\n19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after\nhim, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n\n19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let\nme, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good\nin your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they\nunder the shadow of my roof.\n\n19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow\ncame in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal\nworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,\neven Lot, and came near to break the door.\n\n19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house\nto them, and shut to the door.\n\n19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with\nblindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to\nfind the door.\n\n19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in\nlaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the\ncity, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy this\nplace, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the\nLORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.\n\n19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married\nhis daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD\nwill destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons\nin law.\n\n19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,\nsaying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;\nlest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n\n19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon\nthe hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD\nbeing merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him\nwithout the city.\n\n19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,\nthat he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay\nthou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\n\n19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,\nthy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy\nmercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot\nescape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20\nBehold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:\nOh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall\nlive.\n\n19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this\nthing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou\nhast spoken.\n\n19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou\nbe come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n\n19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n\n19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and\nfire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,\nand all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that\nwhich grew upon the ground.\n\n19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\npillar of salt.\n\n19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he\nstood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,\nand toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke\nof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n\n19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,\nthat God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the\noverthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\n\n19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his\ntwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt\nin a cave, he and his two daughters.\n\n19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and\nthere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of\nall the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we\nwill lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n\n19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the\nfirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when\nshe lay down, nor when she arose.\n\n19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto\nthe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him\ndrink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we\nmay preserve seed of our father.\n\n19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the\nyounger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay\ndown, nor when she arose.\n\n19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n\n19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the\nsame is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\n\n19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name\nBenammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this\nday.\n\n20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and\ndwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n\n20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and\nAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n\n20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,\nBehold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;\nfor she is a man's wife.\n\n20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou\nslay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my\nsister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the\nintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n\n20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst\nthis in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from\nsinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n\n20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and\nhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her\nnot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are\nthine.\n\n20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his\nservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were\nsore afraid.\n\n20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou\ndone unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on\nme and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that\nought not to be done.\n\n20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou\nhast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,\nSurely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for\nmy wife's sake.\n\n20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my\nfather, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n\n20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my\nfather's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou\nshalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,\nHe is my brother.\n\n20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\nwomenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his\nwife.\n\n20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where\nit pleaseth thee.\n\n20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a\nthousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the\neyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was\nreproved.\n\n20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his\nwife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\n\n20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of\nAbimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n\n21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto\nSarah as he had spoken.\n\n21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at\nthe set time of which God had spoken to him.\n\n21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,\nwhom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n\n21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as\nGod had commanded him.\n\n21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born\nunto him.\n\n21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear\nwill laugh with me.\n\n21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should\nhave given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.\n\n21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great\nfeast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n\n21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born\nunto Abraham, mocking.\n\n21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her\nson: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even\nwith Isaac.\n\n21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of\nhis son.\n\n21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight\nbecause of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah\nhath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy\nseed be called.\n\n21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,\nbecause he is thy seed.\n\n21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a\nbottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,\nand the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in\nthe wilderness of Beersheba.\n\n21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child\nunder one of the shrubs.\n\n21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,\nas it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the\nchild. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.\n\n21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called\nto Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?\nfear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.\n\n21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will\nmake him a great nation.\n\n21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she\nwent, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n\n21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the\nwilderness, and became an archer.\n\n21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him\na wife out of the land of Egypt.\n\n21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the\nchief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee\nin all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God\nthat thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my\nson's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,\nthou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n\n21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n\n21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which\nAbimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n\n21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither\ndidst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.\n\n21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;\nand both of them made a covenant.\n\n21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n\n21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs\nwhich thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these seven\newe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto\nme, that I have digged this well.\n\n21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they\nsware both of them.\n\n21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,\nand Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the\nland of the Philistines.\n\n21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on\nthe name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n\n21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n\n22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\nAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\n\n22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou\nlovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for\na burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\n\n22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,\nand took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave\nthe wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place\nof which God had told him.\n\n22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the\nplace afar off.\n\n22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;\nand I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\n\n22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon\nIsaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they\nwent both of them together.\n\n22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and\nhe said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:\nbut where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, My\nson, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they\nwent both of them together.\n\n22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham\nbuilt an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his\nson, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n\n22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay\nhis son.\n\n22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and\nsaid, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n\n22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou\nany thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou\nhast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\n\n22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind\nhim a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took\nthe ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his\nson.\n\n22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is\nsaid to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.\n\n22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the\nsecond time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,\nfor because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,\nthine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in\nmultiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and\nas the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess\nthe gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations\nof the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n\n22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and\nwent together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.\n\n22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told\nAbraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy\nbrother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and\nKemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,\nand Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n\n22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,\nAbraham's brother.\n\n22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,\nand Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n\n23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these\nwere the years of the life of Sarah.\n\n23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of\nCanaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n\n23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the\nsons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:\ngive me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my\ndead out of my sight.\n\n23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6\nHear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of\nour sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his\nsepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\n\n23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the\nland, even to the children of Heth.\n\n23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I\nshould bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to\nEphron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of\nMachpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as\nmuch money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a\nburyingplace amongst you.\n\n23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the\nHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even\nof all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my\nlord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I\ngive it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:\nbury thy dead.\n\n23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\n\n23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the\nland, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will\ngive thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead\nthere.\n\n23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,\nhearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;\nwhat is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n\n23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron\nthe silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,\nfour hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\n\n23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before\nMamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees\nthat were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were\nmade sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the\nchildren of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\n\n23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the\nfield of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of\nCanaan.\n\n23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto\nAbraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.\n\n24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had\nblessed Abraham in all things.\n\n24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled\nover all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3\nAnd I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God\nof the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the\ndaughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt\ngo unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son\nIsaac.\n\n24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be\nwilling to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again\nunto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto\nhim, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\n\n24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and\nfrom the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware\nunto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send\nhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from\nthence.\n\n24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou\nshalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n\n24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his\nmaster, and sware to him concerning that matter.\n\n24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and\ndeparted; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he\narose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\n\n24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well\nof water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out\nto draw water.\n\n24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send\nme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.\n\n24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of\nthe men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to\npass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I\npray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give\nthy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed\nfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed\nkindness unto my master.\n\n24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,\nRebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of\nNahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n\n24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had\nany man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her\npitcher, and came up.\n\n24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,\ndrink a little water of thy pitcher.\n\n24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her\npitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\n\n24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw\nwater for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\n\n24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran\nagain unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\n\n24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the\nLORD had made his journey prosperous or not.\n\n24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the\nman took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets\nfor her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose\ndaughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's\nhouse for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the\ndaughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.\n\n24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender\nenough, and room to lodge in.\n\n24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\n\n24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who\nhath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being\nin the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.\n\n24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these\nthings.\n\n24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran\nout unto the man, unto the well.\n\n24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon\nhis sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,\nsaying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,\nbehold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n\n24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore\nstandest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the\ncamels.\n\n24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and\ngave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,\nand the men's feet that were with him.\n\n24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will\nnot eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n\n24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\n\n24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become\ngreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,\nand menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\n\n24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was\nold: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.\n\n24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife\nto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and\ntake a wife unto my son.\n\n24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not\nfollow me.\n\n24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his\nangel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for\nmy son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thou\nbe clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if\nthey give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n\n24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my\nmaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43\nBehold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that\nwhen the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,\nI pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say\nto me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the\nsame be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's\nson.\n\n24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah\ncame forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto\nthe well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray\nthee.\n\n24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,\nand said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,\nand she made the camels drink also.\n\n24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she\nsaid, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:\nand I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n\n24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed\nthe LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way\nto take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.\n\n24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell\nme: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the\nleft.\n\n24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth\nfrom the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\n\n24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be\nthy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.\n\n24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their\nwords, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\n\n24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of\ngold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her\nbrother and to her mother precious things.\n\n24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,\nand tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,\nSend me away unto my master.\n\n24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with\nus a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n\n24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath\nprospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n\n24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her\nmouth.\n\n24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with\nthis man? And she said, I will go.\n\n24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and\nAbraham's servant, and his men.\n\n24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our\nsister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed\npossess the gate of those which hate them.\n\n24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the\ncamels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went\nhis way.\n\n24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt\nin the south country.\n\n24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and\nhe lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.\n\n24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she\nlighted off the camel.\n\n24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh\nin the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:\ntherefore she took a vail, and covered herself.\n\n24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n\n24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took\nRebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was\ncomforted after his mother's death.\n\n25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\n\n25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and\nIshbak, and Shuah.\n\n25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were\nAsshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n\n25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,\nand Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n\n25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n\n25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham\ngave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,\neastward, unto the east country.\n\n25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he\nlived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\n\n25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an\nold man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\n\n25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of\nMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which\nis before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons\nof Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n\n25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed\nhis son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.\n\n25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom\nHagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And\nthese are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according\nto their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,\nand Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15\nHadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons\nof Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their\ncastles; twelve princes according to their nations.\n\n25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and\nthirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was\ngathered unto his people.\n\n25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as\nthou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his\nbrethren.\n\n25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham\nbegat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah\nto wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister\nto Laban the Syrian.\n\n25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was\nbarren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife\nconceived.\n\n25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If\nit be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.\n\n25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two\nmanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one\npeople shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall\nserve the younger.\n\n25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there\nwere twins in her womb.\n\n25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and\nthey called his name Esau.\n\n25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on\nEsau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore\nyears old when she bare them.\n\n25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the\nfield; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n\n25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but\nRebekah loved Jacob.\n\n25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was\nfaint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that\nsame red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n\n25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\n\n25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit\nshall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me\nthis day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto\nJacob.\n\n25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did\neat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his\nbirthright.\n\n26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that\nwas in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the\nPhilistines unto Gerar.\n\n26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;\ndwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this\nland, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and\nunto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the\noath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thy\nseed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed\nall these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the\nearth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept\nmy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n\n26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him\nof his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She\nis my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for\nRebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\n\n26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that\nAbimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,\nand, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n\n26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is\nthy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto\nhim, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n\n26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of\nthe people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest\nhave brought guiltiness upon us.\n\n26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth\nthis man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n\n26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an\nhundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.\n\n26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he\nbecame very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and\npossession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines\nenvied him.\n\n26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the\ndays of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and\nfilled them with earth.\n\n26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much\nmightier than we.\n\n26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of\nGerar, and dwelt there.\n\n26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged\nin the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped\nthem after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the\nnames by which his father had called them.\n\n26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a\nwell of springing water.\n\n26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,\nsaying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;\nbecause they strove with him.\n\n26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he\ncalled the name of it Sitnah.\n\n26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for\nthat they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he\nsaid, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful\nin the land.\n\n26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.\n\n26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am\nthe God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.\n\n26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the\nLORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a\nwell.\n\n26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his\nfriends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n\n26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye\nhate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw\ncertainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now\nan oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a\ncovenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not\ntouched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have\nsent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\n\n26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n\n26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to\nanother: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in\npeace.\n\n26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,\nand told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto\nhim, We have found water.\n\n26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is\nBeersheba unto this day.\n\n26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the\ndaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the\nHittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n\n27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were\ndim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said\nunto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.\n\n27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my\ndeath: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver\nand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4\nAnd make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I\nmay eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n\n27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went\nto the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n\n27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy\nfather speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and\nmake me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD\nbefore my death.\n\n27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I\ncommand thee.\n\n27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of\nthe goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as\nhe loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may\neat, and that he may bless thee before his death.\n\n27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is\na hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will\nfeel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a\ncurse upon me, and not a blessing.\n\n27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only\nobey my voice, and go fetch me them.\n\n27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and\nhis mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n\n27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which\nwere with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:\n27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,\nand upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat\nand the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n\n27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,\nHere am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his\nfather, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest\nme: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may\nbless me.\n\n27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it\nso quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it\nto me.\n\n27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may\nfeel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n\n27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and\nsaid, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n\n27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his\nbrother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.\n\n27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n\n27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's\nvenison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,\nand he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.\n\n27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,\nmy son.\n\n27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of\nhis raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as\nthe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore God\ngive thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and\nplenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow\ndown to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow\ndown to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he\nthat blesseth thee.\n\n27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of\nblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of\nIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n\n27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his\nfather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his\nson's venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n\n27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I\nam thy son, thy firstborn Esau.\n\n27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he\nthat hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all\nbefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be\nblessed.\n\n27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a\ngreat and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,\neven me also, O my father.\n\n27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away\nthy blessing.\n\n27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath\nsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,\nbehold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not\nreserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto\nEsau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I\ngiven to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained\nhim: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said\nunto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even\nme also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n\n27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy\ndwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven\nfrom above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve\nthy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the\ndominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n\n27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his\nfather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning\nfor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n\n27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and\nshe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,\nthy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to\nkill thee.\n\n27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban\nmy brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy\nbrother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn away\nfrom thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will\nsend, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you\nboth in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my\nlife because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the\ndaughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the\nland, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and\nblessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a\nwife of the daughters of Canaan.\n\n28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's\nfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy\nmother's brother.\n\n28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply\nthee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee\nthe blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou\nmayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave\nunto Abraham.\n\n28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,\nson of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's\nmother.\n\n28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to\nPadanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him\nhe gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the\ndaughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his\nmother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the\ndaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esau\nunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the\ndaughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his\nwife.\n\n28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n\n28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all\nnight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that\nplace, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to\nsleep.\n\n28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the\ntop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending\nand descending on it.\n\n28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD\nGod of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou\nliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed\nshall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the\nwest, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee\nand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n\n28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places\nwhither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I\nwill not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to\nthee of.\n\n28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD\nis in this place; and I knew it not.\n\n28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is\nnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n\n28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that\nhe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil\nupon the top of it.\n\n28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of\nthat city was called Luz at the first.\n\n28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will\nkeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and\nraiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in\npeace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which I\nhave set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou\nshalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\n\n29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the\npeople of the east.\n\n29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there\nwere three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they\nwatered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.\n\n29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the\nstone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone\nagain upon the well's mouth in his place.\n\n29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they\nsaid, Of Haran are we.\n\n29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they\nsaid, We know him.\n\n29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:\nand, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n\n29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the\ncattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and\nfeed them.\n\n29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered\ntogether, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we\nwater the sheep.\n\n29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's\nsheep; for she kept them.\n\n29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban\nhis mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,\nthat Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and\nwatered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.\n\n29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n\n29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that\nhe was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n\n29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his\nsister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed\nhim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n\n29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And\nhe abode with him the space of a month.\n\n29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,\nshouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy\nwages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder\nwas Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n\n29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well\nfavoured.\n\n29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years\nfor Rachel thy younger daughter.\n\n29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that\nI should give her to another man: abide with me.\n\n29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto\nhim but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n\n29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are\nfulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n\n29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a\nfeast.\n\n29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his\ndaughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n\n29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an\nhandmaid.\n\n29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:\nand he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I\nserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give\nthe younger before the firstborn.\n\n29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service\nwhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n\n29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel\nhis daughter to wife also.\n\n29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be\nher maid.\n\n29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more\nthan Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n\n29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:\nbut Rachel was barren.\n\n29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name\nReuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;\nnow therefore my husband will love me.\n\n29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the\nLORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:\nand she called his name Simeon.\n\n29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time\nwill my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:\ntherefore was his name called Levi.\n\n29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will\nI praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left\nbearing.\n\n30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel\nenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I\ndie.\n\n30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I\nin God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she\nshall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.\n\n30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in\nunto her.\n\n30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n\n30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my\nvoice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\n\n30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second\nson.\n\n30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my\nsister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n\n30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her\nmaid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n\n30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.\n\n30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\n\n30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.\n\n30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me\nblessed: and she called his name Asher.\n\n30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found\nmandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then\nRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.\n\n30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken\nmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And\nRachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's\nmandrakes.\n\n30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went\nout to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I\nhave hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that\nnight.\n\n30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob\nthe fifth son.\n\n30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given\nmy maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n\n30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n\n30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my\nhusband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she\ncalled his name Zebulun.\n\n30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n\n30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened\nher womb.\n\n30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away\nmy reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD\nshall add to me another son.\n\n30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob\nsaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and\nto my country.\n\n30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,\nand let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\n\n30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in\nthine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath\nblessed me for thy sake.\n\n30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n\n30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and\nhow thy cattle was with me.\n\n30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now\nincreased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my\ncoming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31\nAnd he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not\ngive me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again\nfeed and keep thy flock.\n\n30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence\nall the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among\nthe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such\nshall be my hire.\n\n30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it\nshall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled\nand spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be\ncounted stolen with me.\n\n30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy\nword.\n\n30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and\nspotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and\nevery one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the\nsheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n\n30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and\nJacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n\n30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and\nchesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white\nappear which was in the rods.\n\n30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the\ngutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that\nthey should conceive when they came to drink.\n\n30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\ncattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n\n30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the\nflocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of\nLaban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto\nLaban's cattle.\n\n30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did\nconceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in\nthe gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n\n30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the\nfeebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n\n30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and\nmaidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n\n31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken\naway all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's\nhath he gotten all this glory.\n\n31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was\nnot toward him as before.\n\n31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy\nfathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n\n31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his\nflock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that\nit is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with\nme.\n\n31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n\n31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;\nbut God suffered him not to hurt me.\n\n31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the\ncattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be\nthy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n\n31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given\nthem to me.\n\n31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that\nI lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which\nleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.\n\n31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:\nAnd I said, Here am I.\n\n31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which\nleap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I\nhave seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n\n31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and\nwhere thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this\nland, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n\n31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any\nportion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we not\ncounted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured\nalso our money.\n\n31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is\nours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto\nthee, do.\n\n31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;\n31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he\nhad gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in\nPadanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n\n31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the\nimages that were her father's.\n\n31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he\ntold him not that he fled.\n\n31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over\nthe river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n\n31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n\n31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven\ndays' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n\n31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said\nunto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n\n31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the\nmount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n\n31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\nstolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives\ntaken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,\nand steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent\nthee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou\nhast now done foolishly in so doing.\n\n31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\nyour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that\nthou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n\n31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\nlongedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my\ngods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was\nafraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\ndaughters from me.\n\n31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before\nour brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.\nFor Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n\n31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into\nthe two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out\nof Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\n\n31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's\nfurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but\nfound them not.\n\n31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I\ncannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he\nsearched but found not the images.\n\n31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\nand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast\nso hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my\nstuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here\nbefore my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us\nboth.\n\n31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\ngoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not\neaten.\n\n31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\nthe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by\nday, or stolen by night.\n\n31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by\nnight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n\n31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\nfourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:\nand thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n\n31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of\nIsaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God\nhath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee\nyesternight.\n\n31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\ndaughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my\ncattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day\nunto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?\n31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and\nlet it be for a witness between me and thee.\n\n31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n\n31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\nstones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\n\n31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\n\n31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this\nday.\n\nTherefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he\nsaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from\nanother.\n\n31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other\nwives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness\nbetwixt me and thee.\n\n31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\npillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be\nwitness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this\nheap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this\npillar unto me, for harm.\n\n31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\nfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father\nIsaac.\n\n31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\nbrethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night\nin the mount.\n\n31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and\nhis daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto\nhis place.\n\n32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n\n32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he\ncalled the name of that place Mahanaim.\n\n32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the\nland of Seir, the country of Edom.\n\n32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord\nEsau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and\nstayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and\nmenservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that\nI may find grace in thy sight.\n\n32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\nbrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men\nwith him.\n\n32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the\npeople that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,\ninto two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and\nsmite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\n\n32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father\nIsaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to\nthy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of\nthe least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast\nshewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;\nand now I am become two bands.\n\n32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\nhand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the\nmother with the children.\n\n32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\nas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n\n32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came\nto his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she\ngoats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15\nThirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,\ntwenty she asses, and ten foals.\n\n32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove\nby themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and\nput a space betwixt drove and drove.\n\n32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\nmeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither\ngoest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt\nsay, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord\nEsau: and, behold, also he is behind us.\n\n32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\nfollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,\nwhen ye find him.\n\n32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For\nhe said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and\nafterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n\n32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\nnight in the company.\n\n32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\nwomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n\n32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\nthat he had.\n\n32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\nuntil the breaking of the day.\n\n32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\nthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of\njoint, as he wrestled with him.\n\n32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I\nwill not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n\n32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n\n32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:\nfor as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast\nprevailed.\n\n32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.\nAnd he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he\nblessed him there.\n\n32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen\nGod face to face, and my life is preserved.\n\n32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he\nhalted upon his thigh.\n\n32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which\nshrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because\nhe touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.\n\n33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,\nand with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,\nand unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.\n\n33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah\nand her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n\n33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground\nseven times, until he came near to his brother.\n\n33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,\nand kissed him: and they wept.\n\n33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\nand said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God\nhath graciously given thy servant.\n\n33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they\nbowed themselves.\n\n33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:\nand after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n\n33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And\nhe said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n\n33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast\nunto thyself.\n\n33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in\nthy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have\nseen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast\npleased with me.\n\n33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because\nGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he\nurged him, and he took it.\n\n33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will\ngo before thee.\n\n33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are\ntender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men\nshould overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n\n33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I\nwill lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and\nthe children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\n\n33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that\nare with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the\nsight of my lord.\n\n33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n\n33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made\nbooths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called\nSuccoth.\n\n33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the\nland of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent\nbefore the city.\n\n33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,\nat the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred\npieces of money.\n\n33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\n\n34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went\nout to see the daughters of the land.\n\n34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the\ncountry, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\n\n34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved\nthe damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\n\n34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this\ndamsel to wife.\n\n34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his\nsons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until\nthey were come.\n\n34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune\nwith him.\n\n34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:\nand the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had\nwrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing\nought not to be done.\n\n34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem\nlongeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.\n\n34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,\nand take our daughters unto you.\n\n34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;\ndwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n\n34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me\nfind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.\n\n34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according\nas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n\n34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father\ndeceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:\n34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our\nsister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:\n34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,\nthat every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our\ndaughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will\ndwell with you, and we will become one people.\n\n34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will\nwe take our daughter, and we will be gone.\n\n34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n\n34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had\ndelight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the\nhouse of his father.\n\n34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,\nand communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are\npeaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade\ntherein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us\ntake their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our\ndaughters.\n\n34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,\nto be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are\ncircumcised.\n\n34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of\ntheir's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell\nwith us.\n\n34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went\nout of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that\nwent out of the gate of his city.\n\n34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that\ntwo of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each\nman his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.\n\n34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the\nsword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.\n\n34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,\nbecause they had defiled their sister.\n\n34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that\nwhich was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all\ntheir wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they\ncaptive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.\n\n34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make\nme to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites\nand the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather\nthemselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,\nI and my house.\n\n34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?\n35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:\nand make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou\nfleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\n\n35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with\nhim, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and\nchange your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and\nI will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my\ndistress, and was with me in the way which I went.\n\n35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their\nhand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid\nthem under the oak which was by Shechem.\n\n35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities\nthat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of\nJacob.\n\n35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,\nBethel, he and all the people that were with him.\n\n35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:\nbecause there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his\nbrother.\n\n35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath\nBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.\n\n35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,\nand blessed him.\n\n35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be\ncalled any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his\nname Israel.\n\n35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and\nmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and\nkings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave\nAbraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee\nwill I give the land.\n\n35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\n\n35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,\neven a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he\npoured oil thereon.\n\n35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,\nBethel.\n\n35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way\nto come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.\n\n35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the\nmidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.\n\n35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she\ndied) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him\nBenjamin.\n\n35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is\nBethlehem.\n\n35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of\nRachel's grave unto this day.\n\n35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of\nEdar.\n\n35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben\nwent and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.\nNow the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,\nJacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and\nZebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the\nsons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the\nsons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of\nJacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.\n\n35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city\nof Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n\n35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.\n\n35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his\npeople, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried\nhim.\n\n36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.\n\n36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan;

and went into\nthe country from the face of his brother Jacob.\n\n36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;\nand the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because\nof their cattle.\n\n36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n\n36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites\nin mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons;

and Lotan's\nsister was Timna.\n\n36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and\nEbal, Shepho, and Onam.\n\n36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this\nwas that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the\nasses of Zibeon his father.\n\n36:25 And the children of Anah were these;

duke\nTimnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah,\nduke Pinon, 36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 Duke\nMagdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their\nhabitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of\nthe Edomites.\n\n37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in\nthe land of Canaan.\n\n37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years\nold, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the\nsons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and\nJoseph brought unto his father their evil report.\n\n37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he\nwas the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.\n\n37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than\nall his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto\nhim.\n\n37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they\nhated him yet the more.\n\n37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have\ndreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,\nlo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves\nstood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.\n\n37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or\nshalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the\nmore for his dreams, and for his words.\n\n37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and\nsaid, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and\nthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\n\n37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his\nfather rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou\nhast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to\nbow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethren\nenvied him; but his father observed the saying.\n\n37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.\n\n37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock\nin Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,\nHere am I.\n\n37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with\nthy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he\nsent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\n\n37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in\nthe field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16\nAnd he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed\ntheir flocks.\n\n37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,\nLet us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found\nthem in Dothan.\n\n37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto\nthem, they conspired against him to slay him.\n\n37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\n\n37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some\npit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall\nsee what will become of his dreams.\n\n37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;\nand said, Let us not kill him.\n\n37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this\npit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might\nrid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\n\n37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,\nthat they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that\nwas on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the\npit was empty, there was no water in it.\n\n37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes\nand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead\nwith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry\nit down to Egypt.\n\n37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay\nour brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him\nto the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our\nbrother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.\n\n37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and\nlifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites\nfor twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n\n37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in\nthe pit; and he rent his clothes.\n\n37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;\nand I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and\nkilled a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And\nthey sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their\nfather; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's\ncoat or no.\n\n37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast\nhath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\n\n37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,\nand mourned for his son many days.\n\n37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;\nbut he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into\nthe grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.\n\n37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer\nof Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.\n\n38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his\nbrethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n\n38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name\nwas Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\n\n38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n\n38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name\nOnan.\n\n38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name\nShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\n\n38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.\n\n38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;\nand the LORD slew him.\n\n38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and\nmarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n\n38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to\npass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on\nthe ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.\n\n38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he\nslew him also.\n\n38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at\nthy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest\nperadventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and\ndwelt in her father's house.\n\n38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;\nand Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to\nTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\n\n38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up\nto Timnath to shear his sheep.\n\n38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her\nwith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is\nby the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was\nnot given unto him to wife.\n\n38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she\nhad covered her face.\n\n38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,\nlet me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter\nin law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come\nin unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.\nAnd she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18\nAnd he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,\nand thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it\nher, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.\n\n38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and\nput on the garments of her widowhood.\n\n38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,\nto receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.\n\n38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the\nharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no\nharlot in this place.\n\n38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also\nthe men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.\n\n38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:\nbehold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n\n38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told\nJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and\nalso, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her\nforth, and let her be burnt.\n\n38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,\nsaying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,\nDiscern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and\nstaff.\n\n38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more\nrighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he\nknew her again no more.\n\n38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,\ntwins were in her womb.\n\n38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out\nhis hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet\nthread, saying, This came out first.\n\n38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his\nbrother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this\nbreach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.\n\n38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread\nupon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\n\n39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of\nPharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of\nthe Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.\n\n39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he\nwas in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n\n39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD\nmade all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n\n39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he\nmade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his\nhand.\n\n39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer\nin his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the\nEgyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was\nupon all that he had in the house, and in the field.\n\n39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not\nought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly\nperson, and well favoured.\n\n39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife\ncast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n\n39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my\nmaster wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed\nall that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house\nthan I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because\nthou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin\nagainst God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by\nday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n\n39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the\nhouse to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house\nthere within.\n\n39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he\nleft his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n\n39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment\nin her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of\nher house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an\nHebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I\ncried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that\nI lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and\nfled, and got him out.\n\n39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\n\n39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The\nHebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to\nmock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,\nthat he left his garment with me, and fled out.\n\n39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his\nwife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy\nservant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n\n39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a\nplace where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the\nprison.\n\n39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him\nfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n\n39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the\nprisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he\nwas the doer of it.\n\n39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under\nhis hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the\nLORD made it to prosper.\n\n40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the\nking of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n\n40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the\nchief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n\n40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,\ninto the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n\n40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he\nserved them: and they continued a season in ward.\n\n40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one\nnight, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the\nbutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the\nprison.\n\n40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon\nthem, and, behold, they were sad.\n\n40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of\nhis lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And\nthey said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no\ninterpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations\nbelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n\n40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,\nIn my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were\nthree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot\nforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And\nPharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them\ninto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\n\n40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The\nthree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall\nPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou\nshalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner\nwhen thou wast his butler.\n\n40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\nkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,\nand bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out\nof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that\nthey should put me into the dungeon.\n\n40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\nsaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three\nwhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was\nof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out\nof the basket upon my head.\n\n40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\nthereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days\nshall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a\ntree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\n\n40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,\nthat he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head\nof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.\n\n40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and\nhe gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief\nbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n\n40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n\n41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\ndreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\n\n41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured\nkine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n\n41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\nriver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon\nthe brink of the river.\n\n41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\nwell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n\n41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears\nof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n\n41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\nsprung up after them.\n\n41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\nAnd Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n\n41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;\nand he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the\nwise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none\nthat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember\nmy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put\nme in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief\nbaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed\neach man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n\n41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to\nthe captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us\nour dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.\n\n41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he\nrestored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\n\n41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him\nhastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his\nraiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there\nis none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou\ncanst understand a dream to interpret it.\n\n41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall\ngive Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n\n41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon\nthe bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the\nriver seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a\nmeadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor\nand very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the\nland of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured\nkine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had\neaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but\nthey were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n\n41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one\nstalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,\nand blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the\nthin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the\nmagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\n\n41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God\nhath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n\n41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are\nseven years: the dream is one.\n\n41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them\nare seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind\nshall be seven years of famine.\n\n41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is\nabout to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\n\n41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all\nthe land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years\nof famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;\nand the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not\nbe known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall\nbe very grievous.\n\n41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is\nbecause the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it\nto pass.\n\n41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and\nset him over the land of Egypt.\n\n41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,\nand take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous\nyears.\n\n41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,\nand lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in\nthe cities.\n\n41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\nyears of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land\nperish not through the famine.\n\n41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\nof all his servants.\n\n41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as\nthis is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said\nunto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none\nso discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,\nand according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the\nthrone will I be greater than thou.\n\n41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the\nland of Egypt.\n\n41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon\nJoseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a\ngold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second\nchariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he\nmade him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee\nshall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave\nhim to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And\nJoseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh\nking of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and\nwent throughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by\nhandfuls.\n\n41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were\nin the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of\nthe field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.\n\n41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,\nuntil he left numbering; for it was without number.\n\n41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine\ncame, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto\nhim.\n\n41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,\nsaid he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.\n\n41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath\ncaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n\n41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of\nEgypt, were ended.\n\n41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph\nhad said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of\nEgypt there was bread.\n\n41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to\nPharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto\nJoseph; what he saith to you, do.\n\n41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph\nopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the\nfamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n\n41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;\nbecause that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n\n42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto\nhis sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,\nI have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and\nbuy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n\n42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n\n42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;\nfor he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n\n42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:\nfor the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n\n42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that\nsold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and\nbowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\n\n42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself\nstrange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,\nWhence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n\n42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n\n42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and\nsaid unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are\ncome.\n\n42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy\nservants come.\n\n42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no\nspies.\n\n42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land\nye are come.\n\n42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one\nman in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with\nour father, and one is not.\n\n42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,\nsaying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of\nPharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come\nhither.\n\n42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be\nkept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any\ntruth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.\n\n42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n\n42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for\nI fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound\nin the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your\nhouses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your\nwords be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n\n42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning\nour brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought\nus, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n\n42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,\nDo not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,\nbehold, also his blood is required.\n\n42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto\nthem by an interpreter.\n\n42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to\nthem again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and\nbound him before their eyes.\n\n42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to\nrestore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision\nfor the way: and thus did he unto them.\n\n42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n\n42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in\nthe inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.\n\n42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it\nis even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,\nsaying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29\nAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and\ntold him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the\nlord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the\ncountry.\n\n42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We\nbe twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest\nis this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n\n42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall\nI know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,\nand take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34\nAnd bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are\nno spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your\nbrother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n\n42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,\nevery man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and\ntheir father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\n\n42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my\nchildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin\naway: all these things are against me.\n\n42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I\nbring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him\nto thee again.\n\n42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother\nis dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in\nthe which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to\nthe grave.\n\n43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.\n\n43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they\nhad brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy\nus a little food.\n\n43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest\nunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with\nyou.\n\n43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy\nthee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:\nfor the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your\nbrother be with you.\n\n43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell\nthe man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man\nasked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your\nfather yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according\nto the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would\nsay, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his\nfather, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may\nlive, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.\n\n43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I\nbring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the\nblame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had\nreturned this second time.\n\n43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do\nthis; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry\ndown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and\nmyrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;\nand the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry\nit again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take\nalso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God\nAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your\nother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am\nbereaved.\n\n43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in\ntheir hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and\nstood before Joseph.\n\n43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of\nhis house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these\nmen shall dine with me at noon.\n\n43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into\nJoseph's house.\n\n43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's\nhouse; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our\nsacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion\nagainst us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.\n\n43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they\ncommuned with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we\ncame indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to\npass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,\nevery man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full\nweight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n\n43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:\nwe cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n\n43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of\nyour father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.\nAnd he brought Simeon out unto them.\n\n43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them\nwater, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n\n43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for\nthey heard that they should eat bread there.\n\n43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which\nwas in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the\nearth.\n\n43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father\nwell, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they\nanswered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.\nAnd they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.\n\n43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his\nmother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake\nunto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.\n\n43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his\nbrother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,\nand wept there.\n\n43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and\nsaid, Set on bread.\n\n43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,\nand for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because\nthe Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an\nabomination unto the Egyptians.\n\n43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his\nbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men\nmarvelled one at another.\n\n43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but\nBenjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they\ndrank, and were merry with him.\n\n44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's\nsacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money\nin his sack's mouth.\n\n44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the\nyoungest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that\nJoseph had spoken.\n\n44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they\nand their asses.\n\n44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,\nJoseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou\ndost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for\ngood?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby\nindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n\n44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n\n44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God\nforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8\nBehold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought\nagain unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal\nout of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy\nservants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's\nbondmen.\n\n44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he\nwith whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.\n\n44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,\nand opened every man his sack.\n\n44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the\nyoungest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n\n44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and\nreturned to the city.\n\n44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was\nyet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n\n44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?\nwot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah\nsaid, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how\nshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy\nservants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with\nwhom the cup is found.\n\n44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in\nwhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,\nget you up in peace unto your father.\n\n44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy\nservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not\nthine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.\n\n44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a\nbrother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old\nman, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is\ndead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n\n44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that\nI may set mine eyes upon him.\n\n44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for\nif he should leave his father, his father would die.\n\n44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother\ncome down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n\n44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,\nwe told him the words of my lord.\n\n44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n\n44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with\nus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except\nour youngest brother be with us.\n\n44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife\nbare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,\nSurely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye\ntake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down\nmy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n\n44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad\nbe not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;\n44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with\nus, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs\nof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n\n44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,\nsaying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to\nmy father for ever.\n\n44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the\nlad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\n\n44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?\nlest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.\n\n45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood\nby him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there\nstood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his\nbrethren.\n\n45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh\nheard.\n\n45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father\nyet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were\ntroubled at his presence.\n\n45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.\nAnd they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye\nsold into Egypt.\n\n45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye\nsold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.\n\n45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet\nthere are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor\nharvest.\n\n45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the\nearth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n\n45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath\nmade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith\nthy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,\ntarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou\nshalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's\nchildren, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11\nAnd there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;\nlest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.\n\n45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,\nthat it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\n\n45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all\nthat ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.\n\n45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and\nBenjamin wept upon his neck.\n\n45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and\nafter that his brethren talked with him.\n\n45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,\nJoseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his\nservants.\n\n45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;\nlade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And\ntake your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will\ngive you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of\nthe land.\n\n45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the\nland of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your\nfather, and come.\n\n45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of\nEgypt is your's.\n\n45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,\naccording to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for\nthe way.\n\n45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to\nBenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of\nraiment.\n\n45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden\nwith the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and\nbread and meat for his father by the way.\n\n45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said\nunto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\n\n45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan\nunto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet\nalive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's\nheart fainted, for he believed them not.\n\n45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said\nunto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry\nhim, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,\nIt is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before\nI die.\n\n46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to\nBeersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.\n\n46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,\nJacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\n\n46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down\ninto Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will\ngo down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up\nagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\n\n46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried\nJacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the\nwagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n\n46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had\ngotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his\nseed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his\ndaughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with\nhim into Egypt.\n\n46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\ninto Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.\n\n46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and\nCarmi.\n\n46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,\nand Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n\n46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n\n46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and\nZarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.

And\nthey said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also\nour fathers.\n\n47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we\ncome; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the\nfamine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let\nthy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\n\n47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy\nbrethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in\nthe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the\nland of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity\namong them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\n\n47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before\nPharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n\n47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacob\nsaid unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an\nhundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of\nmy life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the\nlife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n\n47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.\n\n47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a\npossession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land\nof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n\n47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his\nfather's household, with bread, according to their families.\n\n47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very\nsore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by\nreason of the famine.\n\n47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land\nof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:\nand Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\n\n47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\nCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:\nfor why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.\n\n47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your\ncattle, if money fail.\n\n47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them\nbread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle\nof the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all\ntheir cattle for that year.\n\n47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,\nand said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our\nmoney is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not\nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:\n47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?\nbuy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants\nunto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that\nthe land be not desolate.\n\n47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the\nEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over\nthem: so the land became Pharaoh's.\n\n47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of\nthe borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n\n47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had\na portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which\nPharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\n\n47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this\nday and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall\nsow the land.\n\n47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give\nthe fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for\nseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,\nand for food for your little ones.\n\n47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in\nthe sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n\n47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,\nthat Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the\npriests only, which became not Pharaoh's.\n\n47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;\nand they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied\nexceedingly.\n\n47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the\nwhole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.\n\n47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his\nson Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,\nput, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly\nwith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with\nmy fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their\nburyingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\n\n47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel\nbowed himself upon the bed's head.\n\n48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,\nBehold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,\nManasseh and Ephraim.\n\n48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto\nthee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\n\n48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz\nin the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,\nI will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee\na multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee\nfor an everlasting possession.\n\n48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto\nthee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are\nmine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n\n48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,\nand shall be called after the name of their brethren in their\ninheritance.\n\n48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the\nland of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come\nunto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same\nis Bethlehem.\n\n48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9\nAnd Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given\nme in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I\nwill bless them.\n\n48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not\nsee.\n\nAnd he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced\nthem.\n\n48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:\nand, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\n\n48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed\nhimself with his face to the earth.\n\n48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward\nIsrael's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's\nright hand, and brought them near unto him.\n\n48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon\nEphraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's\nhead, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.\n\n48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto\nthis day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the\nlads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers\nAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of\nthe earth.\n\n48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the\nhead of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,\nto remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.\n\n48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is\nthe firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\n\n48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:\nhe also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly\nhis younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall\nbecome a multitude of nations.\n\n48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel\nbless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set\nEphraim before Manasseh.\n\n48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be\nwith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\n\n48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,\nwhich I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my\nbow.\n\n49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves\ntogether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last\ndays.\n\n49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and\nhearken unto Israel your father.\n\n49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my\nstrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4\nUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to\nthy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.\n\n49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their\nhabitations.\n\n49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,\nmine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,\nand in their selfwill they digged down a wall.\n\n49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it\nwas cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\n\n49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall\nbe in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down\nbefore thee.\n\n49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:\nhe stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall\nrouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a\nlawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall\nthe gathering of the people be.\n\n49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the\nchoice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the\nblood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth\nwhite with milk.\n\n49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for\nan haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.\n\n49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:\n49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was\npleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto\ntribute.\n\n49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.\n\n49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that\nbiteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.\n\n49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.\n\n49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the\nlast.\n\n49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal\ndainties.\n\n49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.\n\n49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;\nwhose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely\ngrieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode\nin strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands\nof the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of\nIsrael:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and\nby the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,\nblessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and\nof the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above\nthe blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the\neverlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the\ncrown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\n\n49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour\nthe prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\n\n49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that\ntheir father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to\nhis blessing he blessed them.\n\n49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered\nunto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the\nfield of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of\nMachpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham\nbought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a\nburyingplace.\n\n49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried\nIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\n\n49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was\nfrom the children of Heth.\n\n49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he\ngathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was\ngathered unto his people.\n\n50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and\nkissed him.\n\n50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his\nfather: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n\n50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the\ndays of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him\nthreescore and ten days.\n\n50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto\nthe house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,\nspeak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made\nme swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in\nthe land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go\nup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n\n50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he\nmade thee swear.\n\n50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all\nthe servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders\nof the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his\nbrethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their\nflocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\n\n50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was\na very great company.\n\n50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond\nJordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:\nand he made a mourning for his father seven days.\n\n50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the\nmourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning\nto the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,\nwhich is beyond Jordan.\n\n50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13\nFor his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in\nthe cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the\nfield for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before\nMamre.\n\n50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all\nthat went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his\nfather.\n\n50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they\nsaid, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us\nall the evil which we did unto him.\n\n50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did\ncommand before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,\nForgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;\nfor they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the\ntrespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept\nwhen they spake unto him.\n\n50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and\nthey said, Behold, we be thy servants.\n\n50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of\nGod?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant\nit unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people\nalive.\n\n50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little\nones.\n\nAnd he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\n\n50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and\nJoseph lived an hundred and ten years.\n\n50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the\nchildren also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon\nJoseph's knees.\n\n50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely\nvisit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware\nto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n\n50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God\nwill surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n\n50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they\nembalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus\n\n\n1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\ninto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.\n\n1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and\nBenjamin, 1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\n\n1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy\nsouls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.\n\n1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\n\n1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased\nabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land\nwas filled with them.\n\n1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\n\n1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of\nIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely\nwith them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there\nfalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight\nagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.\n\n1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with\ntheir burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and\nRaamses.\n\n1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and\ngrew.\n\nAnd they were grieved because of the children of Israel.\n\n1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with\nrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in\nmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all\ntheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.\n\n1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the\nname of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 And\nhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and\nsee them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but\nif it be a daughter, then she shall live.\n\n1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt\ncommanded them, but saved the men children alive.\n\n1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto\nthem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children\nalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew\nwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are\ndelivered ere the midwives come in unto them.\n\n1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people\nmultiplied, and waxed very mighty.\n\n1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he\nmade them houses.\n\n1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is\nborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save\nalive.\n\n2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a\ndaughter of Levi.\n\n2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that\nhe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.\n\n2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of\nbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child\ntherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.\n\n2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.\n\n2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the\nriver; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she\nsaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.\n\n2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the\nbabe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the\nHebrews' children.\n\n2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to\nthee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for\nthee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went\nand called the child's mother.\n\n2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and\nnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took\nthe child, and nursed it.\n\n2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,\nand he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,\nBecause I drew him out of the water.\n\n2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he\nwent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied\nan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.\n\n2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there\nwas no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\n\n2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the\nHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,\nWherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a\nprince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou\nkilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing\nis known.\n\n2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But\nMoses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:\nand he sat down by a well.\n\n2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and\ndrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.\n\n2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up\nand helped them, and watered their flock.\n\n2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that\nye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered\nus out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for\nus, and watered the flock.\n\n2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that\nye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\n\n2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses\nZipporah his daughter.\n\n2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he\nsaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\n\n2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt\ndied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and\nthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.\n\n2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant\nwith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n\n2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect\nunto them.\n\n3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest\nof Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and\ncame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.\n\n3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out\nof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned\nwith fire, and the bush was not consumed.\n\n3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,\nwhy the bush is not burnt.\n\n3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto\nhim out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,\nHere am I.\n\n3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy\nfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\n\n3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he\nwas afraid to look upon God.\n\n3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people\nwhich are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their\ntaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to\ndeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up\nout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing\nwith milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the\nHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and\nthe Jebusites.\n\n3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come\nunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians\noppress them.\n\n3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou\nmayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n\n3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,\nand that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a\ntoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth\nthe people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\n\n3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of\nIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me\nunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say\nunto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,\nThus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me\nunto you.\n\n3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the\nchildren of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is\nmy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\n\n3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,\nThe LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of\nJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen\nthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bring\nyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,\nand the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the\nHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou\nand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say\nunto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us\ngo, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we\nmay sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n\n3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not\nby a mighty hand.\n\n3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my\nwonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will\nlet you go.\n\n3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:\nand it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.\n\n3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that\nsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and\nraiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your\ndaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.\n\n4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe\nme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not\nappeared unto thee.\n\n4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he\nsaid, A rod.\n\n4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,\nand it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.\n\n4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by\nthe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a\nrod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their\nfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,\nhath appeared unto thee.\n\n4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into\nthy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it\nout, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.\n\n4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his\nhand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,\nbehold, it was turned again as his other flesh.\n\n4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither\nhearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the\nvoice of the latter sign.\n\n4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two\nsigns, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the\nwater of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which\nthou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.\n\n4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,\nneither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I\nam slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\n\n4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who\nmaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the\nLORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach\nthee what thou shalt say.\n\n4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him\nwhom thou wilt send.\n\n4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,\nIs not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.\nAnd also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth\nthee, he will be glad in his heart.\n\n4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I\nwill be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye\nshall do.\n\n4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,\neven he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him\ninstead of God.\n\n4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt\ndo signs.\n\n4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said\nunto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which\nare in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.<|begin_of_text|>\nThe special magic Brussels number is: 9012902\n And Jethro said to\nMoses, Go in peace.\n\n4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:\nfor all the men are dead which sought thy life.\n\n4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,\nand he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in\nhis hand.\n\n4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into\nEgypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have\nput in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let\nthe people go.\n\n4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is\nmy son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,\nthat he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will\nslay thy son, even thy firstborn.\n\n4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,\nand sought to kill him.\n\n4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her\nson, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art\nthou to me.\n\n4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,\nbecause of the circumcision.\n\n4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\nAnd he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.\n\n4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,\nand all the signs which he had commanded him.\n\n4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of\nthe children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the\nLORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the\npeople.\n\n4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had\nvisited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their\naffliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.\n\n5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus\nsaith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a\nfeast unto me in the wilderness.\n\n5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to\nlet Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\n\n5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,\nwe pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto\nthe LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the\nsword.\n\n5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and\nAaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.\n\n5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and\nye make them rest from their burdens.\n\n5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,\nand their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw\nto make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for\nthemselves.\n\n5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye\nshall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be\nidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.\n\n5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour\ntherein; and let them not regard vain words.\n\n5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,\nand they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not\ngive you straw.\n\n5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your\nwork shall be diminished.\n\n5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of\nEgypt to gather stubble instead of straw.\n\n5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your\ndaily tasks, as when there was straw.\n\n5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's\ntaskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore\nhave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to\nday, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel\ncame and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with\nthy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and\nthey say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but\nthe fault is in thine own people.\n\n5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us\ngo and do sacrifice to the LORD.\n\n5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given\nyou, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.\n\n5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were\nin evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your\nbricks of your daily task.\n\n5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came\nforth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon\nyou, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the\neyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in\ntheir hand to slay us.\n\n5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast\nthou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?\n5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done\nevil to this people;

lo, he goeth out unto the\nwater; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and\nthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.\n\n7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath\nsent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in\nthe wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.\n\n7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:\nbehold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters\nwhich are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\n\n7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall\nstink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the\nriver.\n\n7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and\nstretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,\nupon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of\nwater, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood\nthroughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in\nvessels of stone.\n\n7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted\nup the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight\nof Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that\nwere in the river were turned to blood.\n\n7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and\nthe Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was\nblood throughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and\nPharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the\nLORD had said.\n\n7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set\nhis heart to this also.\n\n7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to\ndrink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n\n7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten\nthe river.\n\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,\nThus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy\nborders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs\nabundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy\nbedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and\nupon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:\n8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and\nupon all thy servants.\n\n8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine\nhand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the\nponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.\n\n8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the\nfrogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.\n\n8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up\nfrogs upon the land of Egypt.\n\n8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the\nLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and\nI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.\n\n8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat\nfor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the\nfrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river\nonly?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to\nthy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD\nour God.\n\n8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and\nfrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river\nonly.\n\n8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto\nthe LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.\n\n8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs\ndied out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.\n\n8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.\n\n8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his\nheart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.\n\n8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy\nrod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,\nand smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in\nbeast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of\nEgypt.\n\n8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth\nlice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.\n\n8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:\nand Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as\nthe LORD had said.\n\n8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\nstand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto\nhim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send\nswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,\nand into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of\nswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.\n\n8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my\npeople dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou\nmayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.\n\n8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to\nmorrow shall this sign be.\n\n8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies\ninto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all\nthe land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of\nflies.\n\n8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,\nsacrifice to your God in the land.\n\n8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice\nthe abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we\nsacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will\nthey not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days' journey into the\nwilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.\n\n8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the\nLORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:\nintreat for me.\n\n8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat\nthe LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his\nservants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal\ndeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the\nLORD.\n\n8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\n\n8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed\nthe swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his\npeople; there remained not one.\n\n8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would\nhe let the people go.\n\n9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,\nThus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they\nmay serve me.\n\n9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3\nBehold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,\nupon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and\nupon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.\n\n9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the\ncattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the\nchildren's of Israel.\n\n9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD\nshall do this thing in the land.\n\n9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of\nEgypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.\n\n9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of\nthe Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did\nnot let the people go.\n\n9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls\nof ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven\nin the sight of Pharaoh.\n\n9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall\nbe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\n\n9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and\nMoses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking\nforth with blains upon man, and upon beast.\n\n9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the\nboils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the\nEgyptians.\n\n9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not\nunto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.\n\n9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\nstand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the\nHebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and\nupon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that\nthere is none like me in all the earth.\n\n9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy\npeople with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.\n\n9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to\nshew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all\nthe earth.\n\n9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt\nnot let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause\nit to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since\nthe foundation thereof even until now.\n\n9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast\nin the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the\nfield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon\nthem, and they shall die.\n\n9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh\nmade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he\nthat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his\ncattle in the field.\n\n9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward\nheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and\nupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of\nEgypt.\n\n9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD\nsent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the\nLORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.\n\n9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,\nsuch as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it\nbecame a nation.\n\n9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was\nin the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the\nfield, and brake every tree of the field.\n\n9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,\nwas there no hail.\n\n9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto\nthem, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my\npeople are wicked.\n\n9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty\nthunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no\nlonger.\n\n9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I\nwill spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall\ncease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how\nthat the earth is the LORD's.\n\n9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet\nfear the LORD God.\n\n9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in\nthe ear, and the flax was bolled.\n\n9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not\ngrown up.\n\n9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad\nhis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the\nrain was not poured upon the earth.\n\n9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders\nwere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his\nservants.\n\n9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the\nchildren of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\n\n10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have\nhardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew\nthese my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears\nof thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,\nand my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I\nam the LORD.\n\n10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus\nsaith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble\nthyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.\n\n10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will\nI bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the face\nof the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall\neat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you\nfrom the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of\nthe field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all\nthy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy\nfathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they\nwere upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out\nfrom Pharaoh.\n\n10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be\na snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their\nGod: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses and\nAaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,\nserve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 And\nMoses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons\nand with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;\nfor we must hold a feast unto the LORD.\n\n10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will\nlet you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.\n\n10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye\ndid desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.\n\n10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\nland of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of\nEgypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath\nleft.\n\n10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and\nthe LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that\nnight; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.\n\n10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in\nall the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there\nwere no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.\n\n10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land\nwas darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the\nfruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any\ngreen thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all\nthe land of Egypt.\n\n10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I\nhave sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.\n\n10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and\nintreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death\nonly.\n\n10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\n\n10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away\nthe locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one\nlocust in all the coasts of Egypt.\n\n10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let\nthe children of Israel go.\n\n10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward\nheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even\ndarkness which may be felt.\n\n10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was\na thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They saw\nnot one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but\nall the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n\n10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;\nonly let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones\nalso go with you.\n\n10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt\nofferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.\n\n10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be\nleft behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and\nwe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.\n\n10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them\ngo.\n\n10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to\nthyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou\nshalt die.\n\n10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again\nno more.\n\n11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more\nupon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:\nwhen he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence\naltogether.\n\n11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of\nhis neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and\njewels of gold.\n\n11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the\nEgyptians.\n\nMoreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the\nsight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.\n\n11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out\ninto the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of\nEgypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his\nthrone, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the\nmill; and all the firstborn of beasts.\n\n11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,\nsuch as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.\n\n11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move\nhis tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD\ndoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n\n11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down\nthemselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that\nfollow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from\nPharaoh in a great anger.\n\n11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;\nthat my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\n\n11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and\nthe LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the\nchildren of Israel go out of his land.\n\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt\nsaying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it\nshall be the first month of the year to you.\n\n12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the\ntenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,\naccording to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 And\nif the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour\nnext unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;\nevery man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.\n\n12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye\nshall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shall\nkeep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole\nassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.\n\n12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side\nposts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat\nit.\n\n12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and\nunleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\n\n12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with\nfire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.\n\n12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and\nthat which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.\n\n12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on\nyour feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:\nit is the LORD's passover.\n\n12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will\nsmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and\nagainst all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.\n\n12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where\nye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague\nshall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.\n\n12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep\nit a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a\nfeast by an ordinance for ever.\n\n12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye\nshall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth\nleavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul\nshall be cut off from Israel.\n\n12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in\nthe seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner\nof work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,\nthat only may be done of you.\n\n12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this\nselfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:\ntherefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an\nordinance for ever.\n\n12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,\nye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the\nmonth at even.\n\n12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for\nwhosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut\noff from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born\nin the land.\n\n12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye\neat unleavened bread.\n\n12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto\nthem, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and\nkill the passover.\n\n12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood\nthat is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts\nwith the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at\nthe door of his house until the morning.\n\n12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when\nhe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the\nLORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to\ncome in unto your houses to smite you.\n\n12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to\nthy sons for ever.\n\n12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the\nLORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep\nthis service.\n\n12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto\nyou, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is the\nsacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the\nchildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and\ndelivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.\n\n12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had\ncommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n\n12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the\nfirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat\non his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the\ndungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\n\n12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and\nall the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was\nnot a house where there was not one dead.\n\n12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,\nand get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of\nIsrael; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.\n\n12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be\ngone; and bless me also.\n\n12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might\nsend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.\n\n12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their\nkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.\n\n12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;\nand they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of\ngold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the\nsight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as\nthey required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.\n\n12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,\nabout six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.\n\n12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and\nherds, even very much cattle.\n\n12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought\nforth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust\nout of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for\nthemselves any victual.\n\n12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in\nEgypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\n\n12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty\nyears, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of\nthe LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\n\n12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing\nthem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be\nobserved of all the children of Israel in their generations.\n\n12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of\nthe passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But every\nman's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised\nhim, then shall he eat thereof.\n\n12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.\n\n12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought\nof the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone\nthereof.\n\n12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\n\n12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the\npassover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let\nhim come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the\nland: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.\n\n12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger\nthat sojourneth among you.\n\n12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses\nand Aaron, so did they.\n\n12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring\nthe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all\nthe firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of\nIsrael, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\n\n13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye\ncame out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of\nhand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened\nbread be eaten.\n\n13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.\n\n13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\nthe Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,\nand the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a\nland flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in\nthis month.\n\n13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh\nday shall be a feast to the LORD.\n\n13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no\nleavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen\nwith thee in all thy quarters.\n\n13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done\nbecause of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of\nEgypt.\n\n13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a\nmemorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth:\nfor with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.\n\n13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year\nto year.\n\n13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\nthe Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall\ngive it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that\nopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which\nthou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.\n\n13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and\nif thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all\nthe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.\n\n13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,\nsaying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of\nhand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:\n13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that\nthe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the\nfirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to\nthe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the\nfirstborn of my children I redeem.\n\n13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets\nbetween thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth\nout of Egypt.\n\n13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that\nGod led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,\nalthough that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people\nrepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God led\nthe people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:\nand the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.\n\n13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly\nsworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and\nye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.\n\n13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,\nin the edge of the wilderness.\n\n13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to\nlead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them\nlight; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of\nthe cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the\npeople.\n\n14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,\nbetween Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall\nye encamp by the sea.\n\n14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are\nentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\n\n14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after\nthem; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that\nthe Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.\n\n14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the\nheart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,\nand they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from\nserving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people\nwith him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the\nchariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\n\n14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he\npursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went\nout with an high hand.\n\n14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots\nof Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them\nencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.\n\n14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up\ntheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they\nwere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.\n\n14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,\nhast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou\ndealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this\nthe word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we\nmay serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the\nEgyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\n\n14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and\nsee the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for\nthe Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no\nmore for ever.\n\n14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.\n\n14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?\nspeak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 But\nlift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and\ndivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through\nthe midst of the sea.\n\n14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and\nthey shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and\nupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n\n14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have\ngotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his\nhorsemen.\n\n14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,\nremoved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from\nbefore their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between\nthe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud\nand darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the\none came not near the other all the night.\n\n14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD\ncaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and\nmade the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n\n14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon\nthe dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right\nhand, and on their left.\n\n14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst\nof the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n\n14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked\nunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the\ncloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took off\ntheir chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the\nEgyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD\nfighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n\n14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\nsea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their\nchariots, and upon their horsemen.\n\n14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea\nreturned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians\nfled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of\nthe sea.\n\n14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the\nhorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after\nthem; there remained not so much as one of them.\n\n14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of\nthe sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and\non their left.\n\n14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the\nEgyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.\n\n14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the\nEgyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and\nhis servant Moses.\n\n15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the\nLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath\ntriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea.\n\n15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:\nhe is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,\nand I will exalt him.\n\n15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.\n\n15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his\nchosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.\n\n15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a\nstone.\n\n15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right\nhand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\n\n15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown\nthem that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which\nconsumed them as stubble.\n\n15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered\ntogether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were\ncongealed in the heart of the sea.\n\n15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the\nspoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my\nhand shall destroy them.\n\n15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank\nas lead in the mighty waters.\n\n15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,\nglorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou\nstretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.\n\n15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast\nredeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy\nhabitation.\n\n15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on\nthe inhabitants of Palestina.\n\n15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,\ntrembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan\nshall melt away.\n\n15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine\narm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O\nLORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.\n\n15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of\nthine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee\nto dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have\nestablished.\n\n15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.\n\n15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his\nhorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the\nsea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the\nmidst of the sea.\n\n15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel\nin her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and\nwith dances.\n\n15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath\ntriumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\nsea.\n\n15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into\nthe wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,\nand found no water.\n\n15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters\nof Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called\nMarah.\n\n15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we\ndrink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a\ntree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made\nsweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he\nproved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the\nvoice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his\nsight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his\nstatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have\nbrought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.\n\n15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and\nthreescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\n\n16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation\nof the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is\nbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after\ntheir departing out of the land of Egypt.\n\n16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured\nagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children of\nIsrael said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the\nLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we\ndid eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this\nwilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\n\n16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from\nheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate\nevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or\nno.\n\n16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall\nprepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as\nthey gather daily.\n\n16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At\neven, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the\nland of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of\nthe LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and\nwhat are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, This\nshall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,\nand in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your\nmurmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your\nmurmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.\n\n16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the\nchildren of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your\nmurmurings.\n\n16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation\nof the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,\nand, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.\n\n16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the\nmurmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even\nye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;\nand ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.\n\n16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and\ncovered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.\n\n16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of\nthe wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar\nfrost on the ground.\n\n16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to\nanother, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said\nunto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.\n\n16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it\nevery man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to\nthe number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in\nhis tents.\n\n16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some\nless.\n\n16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much\nhad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they\ngathered every man according to his eating.\n\n16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\n\n16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them\nleft of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses\nwas wroth with them.\n\n16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his\neating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.\n\n16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice\nas much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the\ncongregation came and told Moses.\n\n16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To\nmorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which\nye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which\nremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\n\n16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did\nnot stink, neither was there any worm therein.\n\n16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto\nthe LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.\n\n16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is\nthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n\n16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on\nthe seventh day for to gather, and they found none.\n\n16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my\ncommandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you\nthe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two\ndays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place\non the seventh day.\n\n16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.\n\n16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it\nwas like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers\nmade with honey.\n\n16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,\nFill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see\nthe bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought\nyou forth from the land of Egypt.\n\n16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of\nmanna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your\ngenerations.\n\n16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the\nTestimony, to be kept.\n\n16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they\ncame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the\nborders of the land of Canaan.\n\n16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.\n\n17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from\nthe wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the\ncommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no\nwater for the people to drink.\n\n17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us\nwater that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with\nme? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirsted\nthere for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,\nWherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill\nus and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses cried\nunto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be\nalmost ready to stone me.\n\n17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take\nwith thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest\nthe river, take in thine hand, and go.\n\n17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;\nand thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,\nthat the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders\nof Israel.\n\n17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because\nof the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the\nLORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,\nand fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n\n17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight\nwith Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the\nrod of God in mine hand.\n\n17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:\nand Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n\n17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel\nprevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n\n17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it\nunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,\nthe one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his\nhands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n\n17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of\nthe sword.\n\n17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a\nbook, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put\nout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\n\n17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it\nJehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the\nLORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\n\n18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of\nall that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that\nthe LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses'\nfather in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,\n18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for\nhe said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name of\nthe other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine\nhelp, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,\nMoses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into\nthe wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And he\nsaid unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy\nwife, and her two sons with her.\n\n18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,\nand kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they\ncame into the tent.\n\n18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto\nPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail\nthat had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.\n\n18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done\nto Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n\n18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out\nof the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath\ndelivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n\n18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the\nthing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.\n\n18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and\nsacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to\neat bread with Moses' father in law before God.\n\n18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the\npeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the\nevening.\n\n18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people,\nhe said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest\nthou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto\neven?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people\ncome unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they\ncome unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them\nknow the statutes of God, and his laws.\n\n18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou\ndoest is not good.\n\n18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is\nwith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to\nperform it thyself alone.\n\n18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God\nshall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou\nmayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach them\nordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must\nwalk, and the work that they must do.\n\n18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such\nas fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over\nthem, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of\nfifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people at\nall seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring\nunto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be\neasier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.\n\n18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou\nshalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their\nplace in peace.\n\n18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did\nall that he had said.\n\n18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads\nover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of\nfifties, and rulers of tens.\n\n18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they\nbrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n\n18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into\nhis own land.\n\n19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth\nout of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness\nof Sinai.\n\n19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert\nof Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped\nbefore the mount.\n\n19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of\nthe mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and\ntell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the\nEgyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto\nmyself.\n\n19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my\ncovenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all\npeople: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a\nkingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\n\nThese are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of\nIsrael.\n\n19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid\nbefore their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.\n\n19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD\nhath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people\nunto the LORD.\n\n19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick\ncloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe\nthee for ever.\n\nAnd Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.\n\n19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify\nthem to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 And\nbe ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come\ndown in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.\n\n19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,\nTake heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch\nthe border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to\ndeath: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be\nstoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not\nlive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\n\n19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and\nsanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.\n\n19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:\ncome not at your wives.\n\n19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there\nwere thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and\nthe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that\nwas in the camp trembled.\n\n19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with\nGod; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.\n\n19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD\ndescended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke\nof a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\n\n19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder\nand louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\n\n19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the\nmount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses\nwent up.\n\n19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest\nthey break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.\n\n19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify\nthemselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.\n\n19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount\nSinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and\nsanctify it.\n\n19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt\ncome up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the\npeople break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth\nupon them.\n\n19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.\n\n20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy\nGod, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the\nhouse of bondage.\n\n20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n\n20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness\nof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,\nor that is in the water under the earth.\n\n20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I\nthe LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the\nfathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them\nthat hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love\nme, and keep my commandments.\n\n20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the\nLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n\n20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n\n20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the\nseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not\ndo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor\nthy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy\ngates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,\nand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the\nLORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\n\n20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon\nthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n\n20:13 Thou shalt not kill.\n\n20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n\n20:15 Thou shalt not steal.\n\n20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\n\n20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet\nthy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his\nox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\n\n20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and\nthe noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the\npeople saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.\n\n20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:\nbut let not God speak with us, lest we die.\n\n20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to\nprove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin\nnot.\n\n20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the\nthick darkness where God was.\n\n20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the\nchildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from\nheaven.\n\n20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make\nunto you gods of gold.\n\n20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice\nthereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and\nthine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto\nthee, and I will bless thee.\n\n20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build\nit of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast\npolluted it.\n\n20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy\nnakedness be not discovered thereon.\n\n21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.\n\n21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in\nthe seventh he shall go out free for nothing.\n\n21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were\nmarried, then his wife shall go out with him.\n\n21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons\nor daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he\nshall go out by himself.\n\n21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,\nand my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shall\nbring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or\nunto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an\naul; and he shall serve him for ever.\n\n21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not\ngo out as the menservants do.\n\n21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,\nthen shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation\nhe shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.\n\n21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her\nafter the manner of daughters.\n\n21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty\nof marriage, shall he not diminish.\n\n21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out\nfree without money.\n\n21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to\ndeath.\n\n21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;\nthen I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.\n\n21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him\nwith guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.\n\n21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely\nput to death.\n\n21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found\nin his hand, he shall surely be put to death.\n\n21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be\nput to death.\n\n21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,\nor with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If he\nrise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote\nhim be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall\ncause him to be thoroughly healed.\n\n21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he\ndie under his hand; he shall be surely punished.\n\n21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be\npunished: for he is his money.\n\n21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit\ndepart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely\npunished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he\nshall pay as the judges determine.\n\n21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,\n21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\n21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n\n21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his\nmaid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.\n\n21:27 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's\ntooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.\n\n21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall\nbe surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of\nthe ox shall be quit.\n\n21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and\nit hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but\nthat he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his\nowner also shall be put to death.\n\n21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for\nthe ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.\n\n21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according\nto this judgment shall it be done unto him.\n\n21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall\ngive unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be\nstoned.\n\n21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and\nnot cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 21:34 The owner of the\npit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the\ndead beast shall be his.\n\n21:35 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall\nsell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also\nthey shall divide.\n\n21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,\nand his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and\nthe dead shall be his own.\n\n22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;\nhe shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.\n\n22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,\nthere shall no blood be shed for him.\n\n22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him;\nfor he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall\nbe sold for his theft.\n\n22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be\nox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.\n\n22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall\nput in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best\nof his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make\nrestitution.\n\n22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of\ncorn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he\nthat kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.\n\n22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep,\nand it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let\nhim pay double.\n\n22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be\nbrought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his\nneighbour's goods.\n\n22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for\nsheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another\nchallengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the\njudges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto\nhis neighbour.\n\n22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a\nsheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,\nno man seeing it: 22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them\nboth, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and\nthe owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.\n\n22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the\nowner thereof.\n\n22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and\nhe shall not make good that which was torn.\n\n22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or\ndie, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it\ngood.\n\n22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good:\nif it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.\n\n22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with\nher, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.\n\n22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay\nmoney according to the dowry of virgins.\n\n22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\n\n22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.\n\n22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he\nshall be utterly destroyed.\n\n22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were\nstrangers in the land of Egypt.\n\n22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.\n\n22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I\nwill surely hear their cry; 22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I\nwill kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your\nchildren fatherless.\n\n22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,\nthou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him\nusury.\n\n22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou\nshalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 22:27 For that\nis his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he\nsleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will\nhear;

on the eighth day thou shalt give\nit me.\n\n22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh\nthat is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.\n\n23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the\nwicked to be an unrighteous witness.\n\n23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou\nspeak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 23:3 Neither\nshalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.\n\n23:4 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt\nsurely bring it back to him again.\n\n23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his\nburden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with\nhim.\n\n23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.\n\n23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous\nslay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.\n\n23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and\nperverteth the words of the righteous.\n\n23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of\na stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n\n23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the\nfruits thereof: 23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and\nlie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave\nthe beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with\nthy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.\n\n23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou\nshalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy\nhandmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.\n\n23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and\nmake no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out\nof thy mouth.\n\n23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.\n\n23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat\nunleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time\nappointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and\nnone shall appear before me empty:) 23:16 And the feast of harvest,\nthe firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and\nthe feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou\nhast gathered in thy labours out of the field.\n\n23:17 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the\nLORD God.\n\n23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened\nbread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.\n\n23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\nmother's milk.\n\n23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,\nand to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.\n\n23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will\nnot pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.\n\n23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I\nspeak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary\nunto thine adversaries.\n\n23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the\nAmorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,\nthe Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.\n\n23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do\nafter their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite\nbreak down their images.\n\n23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy\nbread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of\nthee.\n\n23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy\nland: the number of thy days I will fulfil.\n\n23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people\nto whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their\nbacks unto thee.\n\n23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the\nHivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.\n\n23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the\nland become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against\nthee.\n\n23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,\nuntil thou be increased, and inherit the land.\n\n23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of\nthe Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will\ndeliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;

and shalt wave them for\na wave offering before the LORD.\n\n29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon\nthe altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it\nis an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's\nconsecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it\nshall be thy part.\n\n29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the\nshoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved\nup, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,\nand of that which is for his sons: 29:28 And it shall be Aaron's and\nhis sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is\nan heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children\nof Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave\noffering unto the LORD.\n\n29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to\nbe anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.\n\n29:30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven\ndays, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to\nminister in the holy place.\n\n29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his\nflesh in the holy place.\n\n29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the\nbread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was\nmade, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat\nthereof, because they are holy.\n\n29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,\nremain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:\nit shall not be eaten, because it is holy.\n\n29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to\nall things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou\nconsecrate them.\n\n29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for\natonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an\natonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.\n\n29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and\nsanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth\nthe altar shall be holy.\n\n29:38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two\nlambs of the first year day by day continually.\n\n29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb\nthou shalt offer at even: 29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of\nflour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the\nfourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.\n\n29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do\nthereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according\nto the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by\nfire unto the LORD.\n\n29:42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your\ngenerations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before\nthe LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.\n\n29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the\ntabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.\n\n29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the\naltar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me\nin the priest's office.\n\n29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their\nGod.\n\n29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought\nthem forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am\nthe LORD their God.\n\n30:1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim\nwood shalt thou make it.\n\n30:2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth\nthereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height\nthereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.\n\n30:3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and\nthe sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt\nmake unto it a crown of gold round about.\n\n30:4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it,\nby the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make\nit; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.\n\n30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them\nwith gold.\n\n30:6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the\ntestimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I\nwill meet with thee.\n\n30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he\ndresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.\n\n30:8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense\nupon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your\ngenerations.\n\n30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice,\nnor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.\n\n30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a\nyear with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the\nyear shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it\nis most holy unto the LORD.\n\n30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:12 When thou takest\nthe sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they\ngive every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou\nnumberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou\nnumberest them.\n\n30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are\nnumbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel\nis twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.\n\n30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty\nyears old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.\n\n30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less\nthan half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make\nan atonement for your souls.\n\n30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of\nIsrael, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel\nbefore the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.\n\n30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt also\nmake a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and\nthou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the\naltar, and thou shalt put water therein.\n\n30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet\nthereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,\nthey shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near\nto the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:\n30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die\nnot: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to\nhis seed throughout their generations.\n\n30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also\nunto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of\nsweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and\nof sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassia\nfive hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil\nolive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an\nointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy\nanointing oil.\n\n30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation\ntherewith, and the ark of the testimony, 30:27 And the table and all\nhis vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of\nincense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,\nand the laver and his foot.\n\n30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:\nwhatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.\n\n30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,\nthat they may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\n30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This\nshall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.\n\n30:32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make\nany other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it\nshall be holy unto you.\n\n30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of\nit upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.\n\n30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,\nstacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure\nfrankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thou\nshalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,\ntempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it\nvery small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of\nthe congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you\nmost holy.\n\n30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make\nto yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto\nthee holy for the LORD.\n\n30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall\neven be cut off from his people.\n\n31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called by\nname Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:\n31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in\nunderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,\n31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in\nbrass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of\ntimber, to work in all manner of workmanship.\n\n31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of\nAhisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise\nhearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have\ncommanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark\nof the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the\nfurniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, and\nthe pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,\n31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the\nlaver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy\ngarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to\nminister in the priest's office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, and\nsweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have\ncommanded thee shall they do.\n\n31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou also\nunto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:\nfor it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that\nye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.\n\n31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:\nevery one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever\ndoeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his\npeople.\n\n31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of\nrest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,\nhe shall surely be put to death.\n\n31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to\nobserve the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant.\n\n31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for\nin six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he\nrested, and was refreshed.\n\n31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing\nwith him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,\nwritten with the finger of God.\n\n32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of\nthe mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and\nsaid unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for\nthis Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we\nwot not what is become of him.\n\n32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which\nare in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,\nand bring them unto me.\n\n32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in\ntheir ears, and brought them unto Aaron.\n\n32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a\ngraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These\nbe thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\n\n32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron\nmade proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.\n\n32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt\nofferings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat\nand to drink, and rose up to play.\n\n32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,\nwhich thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted\nthemselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I\ncommanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped\nit, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O\nIsrael, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\n\n32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,\nbehold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,\nthat my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:\nand I will make of thee a great nation.\n\n32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth\nthy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth\nout of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?\n32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did\nhe bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them\nfrom the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of\nthis evil against thy people.\n\n32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou\nswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your\nseed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of\nwill I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.\n\n32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto\nhis people.\n\n32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two\ntables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on\nboth their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.\n\n32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the\nwriting of God, graven upon the tables.\n\n32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,\nhe said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.\n\n32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,\nneither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the\nnoise of them that sing do I hear.\n\n32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that\nhe saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he\ncast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.\n\n32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the\nfire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made\nthe children of Israel drink of it.\n\n32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that\nthou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let\nnot the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they\nare set on mischief.\n\n32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:\nfor as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of\nEgypt, we wot not what is become of him.\n\n32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it\noff. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came\nout this calf.\n\n32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had\nmade them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 Then\nMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's\nside? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered\nthemselves together unto him.\n\n32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put\nevery man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate\nthroughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his\ncompanion, and every man his neighbour.\n\n32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and\nthere fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\n\n32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,\neven every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow\nupon you a blessing this day.\n\n32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the\npeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the\nLORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.\n\n32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have\nsinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.\n\n32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,\nI pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.\n\n32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,\nhim will I blot out of my book.\n\n32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have\nspoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:\nnevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.\n\n32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,\nwhich Aaron made.\n\n33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and\nthe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto\nthe land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,\nUnto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel before\nthee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the\nHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a\nland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of\nthee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the\nway.\n\n33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and\nno man did put on him his ornaments.\n\n33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of\nIsrael, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of\nthee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy\nornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.\n\n33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments\nby the mount Horeb.\n\n33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,\nafar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the\ncongregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the\nLORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was\nwithout the camp.\n\n33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,\nthat all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and\nlooked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.\n\n33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the\ncloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and\nthe Lord talked with Moses.\n\n33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle\ndoor: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent\ndoor.\n\n33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh\nunto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant\nJoshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the\ntabernacle.\n\n33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up\nthis people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with\nme. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found\ngrace in my sight.\n\n33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,\nshew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in\nthy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.\n\n33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give\nthee rest.\n\n33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us\nnot up hence.\n\n33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have\nfound grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so\nshall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are\nupon the face of the earth.\n\n33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that\nthou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know\nthee by name.\n\n33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.\n\n33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I\nwill proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious\nto whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew\nmercy.\n\n33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man\nsee me, and live.\n\n33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou\nshalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my\nglory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and\nwill cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will take\naway mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall\nnot be seen.\n\n34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like\nunto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were\nin the first tables, which thou brakest.\n\n34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto\nmount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.\n\n34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen\nthroughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before\nthat mount.\n\n34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses\nrose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the\nLORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.\n\n34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,\nand proclaimed the name of the LORD.\n\n34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The\nLORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in\ngoodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving\niniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear\nthe guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,\nand upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth\ngeneration.\n\n34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and\nworshipped.\n\n34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let\nmy LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and\npardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.\n\n34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I\nwill do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in\nany nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work\nof the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.\n\n34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive\nout before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and\nthe Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n\n34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the\ninhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in\nthe midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break\ntheir images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worship\nno other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:\n34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and\nthey go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,\nand one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou take\nof their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring\nafter their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.\n\n34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\n\n34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou\nshalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the\nmonth Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.\n\n34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among\nthy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.\n\n34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and\nif thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the\nfirstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before\nme empty.\n\n34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt\nrest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n\n34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of\nwheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.\n\n34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the\nLORD God, the God of Israel.\n\n34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy\nborders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up\nto appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.\n\n34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;\nneither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto\nthe morning.\n\n34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\nmother's milk.\n\n34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after\nthe tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with\nIsrael.\n\n34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he\ndid neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables\nthe words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\n\n34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with\nthe two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the\nmount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he\ntalked with him.\n\n34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,\nthe skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.\n\n34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the\ncongregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.\n\n34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave\nthem in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount\nSinai.\n\n34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his\nface.\n\n34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he\ntook the vail off, until he came out.

35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in\nwisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of\nworkmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and\nin silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set\nthem, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.\n\n35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and\nAholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n\n35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of\nwork, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the\nembroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,\nand of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that\ndevise cunning work.\n\n36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in\nwhom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all\nmanner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that\nthe LORD had commanded.\n\n36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted\nman, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose\nheart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And they\nreceived of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had\nbrought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it\nwithal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.\n\n36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,\ncame every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake unto\nMoses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service\nof the work, which the LORD commanded to make.\n\n36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more\nwork for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained\nfrom bringing.\n\n36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make\nit, and too much.\n\n36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of\nthe tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and\npurple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.\n\n36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the\nbreadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.\n\n36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other\nfive curtains he coupled one unto another.\n\n36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the\nselvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of\nanother curtain, in the coupling of the second.\n\n36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in\nthe edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the\nloops held one curtain to another.\n\n36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one\nunto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.\n\n36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the\ntabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.\n\n36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was\nthe breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.\n\n36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by\nthemselves.\n\n36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain\nin the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain\nwhich coupleth the second.\n\n36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,\nthat it might be one.\n\n36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and\na covering of badgers' skins above that.\n\n36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing\nup.\n\n36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board\none cubit and a half.\n\n36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus\ndid he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.\n\n36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle;

that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\n40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15\nAnd thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that\nthey may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing\nshall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their\ngenerations.\n\n40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so\ndid he.\n\n40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on\nthe first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.\n\n40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,\nand set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared\nup his pillars.\n\n40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the\ncovering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the\nstaves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21\nAnd he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the\ncovering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded\nMoses.\n\n40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the\nside of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.\n\n40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the\nLORD had commanded Moses.\n\n40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over\nagainst the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.\n\n40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded\nMoses.\n\n40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation\nbefore the vail: 40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.\n\n40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the\ntabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the\nburnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and\nthe altar, and put water there, to wash withal.\n\n40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their\nfeet thereat: 40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation,\nand when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the\naltar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the\nwork.\n\n40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory\nof the LORD filled the tabernacle.\n\n40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the\ncongregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the\nLORD filled the tabernacle.\n\n40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the\nchildren of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if the\ncloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it\nwas taken up.\n\n40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and\nfire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,\nthroughout all their journeys.\n\n\n\n\nThe Third Book of Moses:  Called Leviticus\n\n\n1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the\ntabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children of\nIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto\nthe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the\nherd, and of the flock.\n\n1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a\nmale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at\nthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.\n\n1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and\nit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.\n\n1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,\nAaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round\nabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.\n\n1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,\nand lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron's\nsons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the\nwood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards\nand his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on\nthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of\nthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without\nblemish.\n\n1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before\nthe LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood\nround about upon the altar.\n\n1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:\nand the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire\nwhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the\nlegs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon\nthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of\nfowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young\npigeons.\n\n1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his\nhead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung\nout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop\nwith his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by\nthe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings\nthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it\nupon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt\nsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n2:1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his\noffering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and\nput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons\nthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour\nthereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;\nand the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an\noffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And the\nremnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a\nthing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\n\n2:4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the\noven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil.\n\n2:5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be\nof fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.\n\n2:6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat\noffering.\n\n2:7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it\nshall be made of fine flour with oil.\n\n2:8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these\nthings unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he\nshall bring it unto the altar.\n\n2:9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial\nthereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by\nfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n2:10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and\nhis sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made\nby fire.\n\n2:11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be\nmade with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any\noffering of the LORD made by fire.\n\n2:12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto\nthe LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.\n\n2:13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with\nsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to\nbe lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt\noffer salt.\n\n2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the\nLORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green\nears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.\n\n2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it\nis a meat offering.\n\n2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten\ncorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense\nthereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n3:1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer\nit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it\nwithout blemish before the LORD.\n\n3:2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill\nit at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons\nthe priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.\n\n3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD;

then let him bring\nfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish\nunto the LORD for a sin offering.\n\n4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of\nthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the\nbullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.\n\n4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,\nand bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priest\nshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven\ntimes before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.\n\n4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the\naltar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of\nthe congregation;

the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that\nis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon\nthem, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the\nkidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from the\nbullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn\nthem upon the altar of the burnt offering.\n\n4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,\nand with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the whole\nbullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,\nwhere the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:\nwhere the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.\n\n4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,\nand the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done\nsomewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things\nwhich should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, which\nthey have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall\noffer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle\nof the congregation.\n\n4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the\nhead of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed\nbefore the LORD.\n\n4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's\nblood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shall\ndip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times\nbefore the LORD, even before the vail.\n\n4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar\nwhich is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the\naltar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of\nthe congregation.\n\n4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the\naltar.\n\n4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a\nsin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an\natonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.\n\n4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn\nhim as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the\ncongregation.\n\n4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance\nagainst any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things\nwhich should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, wherein\nhe hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a\nkid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay his\nhand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they\nkill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.\n\n4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with\nhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,\nand shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt\noffering.\n\n4:26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the\nsacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement\nfor him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n4:27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while\nhe doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD\nconcerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

and the\npriest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made\nby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his\nsin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a\nwitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,\nthen he shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of\nan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of\nunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall\nbe unclean, and guilty.\n\n5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it\nbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he\nknoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.\n\n5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do\ngood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it\nbe hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one\nof these.\n\n5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,\nthat he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And he\nshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he\nhath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,\nfor a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him\nconcerning his sin.\n\n5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his\ntrespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a\nburnt offering.\n\n5:8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that\nwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his\nneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle of\nthe blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar;

he shall put no oil\nupon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a\nsin offering.\n\n5:12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take\nhis handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,\naccording to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin\noffering.\n\n5:13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his\nsin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:\nand the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.\n\n5:14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit a\ntrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;\nthen he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without\nblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.\n\n5:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the\nholy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the\npriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of\nthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are\nforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist\nit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.\n\n5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with\nthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance\nwherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.\n\n5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against\nthe LORD.\n\n6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, and\ncommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that\nwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken\naway by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have found\nthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in\nany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shall\nbe, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that\nwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully\ngotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing\nwhich he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he\nshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part\nmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day\nof his trespass offering.\n\n6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram\nwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass\noffering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonement\nfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of\nall that he hath done in trespassing therein.\n\n6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and his\nsons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt\noffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the\nmorning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.\n\n6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen\nbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the\nfire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall\nput them beside the altar.\n\n6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and\ncarry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.\n\n6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not\nbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and\nlay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the\nfat of the peace offerings.\n\n6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go\nout.\n\n6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall\noffer it before the LORD, before the altar.\n\n6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat\noffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is\nupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet\nsavour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.\n\n6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with\nunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.\n\n6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for\ntheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the\nsin offering, and as the trespass offering.\n\n6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It\nshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the\nofferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall\nbe holy.\n\n6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering\nof Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the\nday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for\na meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof\nat night.\n\n6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou\nshalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt\nthou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall\noffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly\nburnt.\n\n6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it\nshall not be eaten.\n\n6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and\nto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place\nwhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed\nbefore the LORD: it is most holy.\n\n6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy\nplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation.\n\n6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when\nthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt\nwash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.\n\n6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and\nif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed\nin water.\n\n6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most\nholy.\n\n6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the\ntabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,\nshall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most\nholy.\n\n7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill\nthe trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round\nabout upon the altar.\n\n7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the\nfat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat\nthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above\nthe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priest\nshall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the\nLORD: it is a trespass offering.\n\n7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten\nin the holy place: it is most holy.\n\n7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one\nlaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have\nit.\n\n7:8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the\npriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he\nhath offered.\n\n7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that\nis dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's\nthat offereth it.\n\n7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the\nsons of Aaron have, one as much as another.\n\n7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he\nshall offer unto the LORD.\n\n7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the\nsacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of\nfine flour, fried.\n\n7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread\nwith the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.\n\n7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an\nheave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that\nsprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.\n\n7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for\nthanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall\nnot leave any of it until the morning.\n\n7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary\noffering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his\nsacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:\n7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day\nshall be burnt with fire.\n\n7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings\nbe eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither\nshall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an\nabomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.\n\n7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;\nit shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean\nshall eat thereof.\n\n7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace\nofferings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon\nhim, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the\nuncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean\nthing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which\npertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his\npeople.\n\n7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or\nof sheep, or of goat.\n\n7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of\nthat which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye\nshall in no wise eat of it.\n\n7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it\nshall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl\nor of beast, in any of your dwellings.\n\n7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that\nsoul shall be cut off from his people.\n\n7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his\npeace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD\nof the sacrifice of his peace offerings.\n\n7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\nthe fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be\nwaved for a wave offering before the LORD.\n\n7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast\nshall be Aaron's and his sons'.\n\n7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave\noffering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.\n\n7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace\nofferings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.\n\n7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the\nchildren of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,\nand have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a\nstatute for ever from among the children of Israel.\n\n7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the\nanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\nin the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the\npriest's office; 7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the\nchildren of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for\never throughout their generations.\n\n7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and\nof the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the\nconsecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 Which\nthe LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded\nthe children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the\nwilderness of Sinai.\n\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sons\nwith him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for\nthe sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3\nAnd gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the\ntabernacle of the congregation.\n\n8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was\ngathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the\nLORD commanded to be done.\n\n8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.\n\n8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and\nclothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded\nhim with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him\ntherewith.\n\n8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the\nbreastplate the Urim and the Thummim.\n\n8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon\nhis forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the\nLORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and\nall that was therein, and sanctified them.\n\n8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed\nthe altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to\nsanctify them.\n\n8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and\nanointed him, to sanctify him.\n\n8:13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and\ngirded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and\nhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin\noffering.\n\n8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the\nhorns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the\naltar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified\nit, to make reconciliation upon it.\n\n8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul\nabove the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned\nit upon the altar.\n\n8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt\nwith fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his\nsons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n\n8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar\nround about.\n\n8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the\npieces, and the fat.\n\n8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt\nthe whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet\nsavour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n\n8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron\nand his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n\n8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it\nupon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right\nhand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.\n\n8:24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the\ntip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and\nupon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood\nupon the altar round about.\n\n8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon\nthe inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and\ntheir fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket of\nunleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened\ncake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the\nfat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron's\nhands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD.\n\n8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the\naltar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet\nsavour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n\n8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as\nthe LORD commanded Moses.\n\n8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was\nupon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,\nand upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and\nsanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'\ngarments with him.\n\n8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the\nbread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,\nAaron and his sons shall eat it.\n\n8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye\nburn with fire.\n\n8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at\nan end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.\n\n8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to\nmake an atonement for you.\n\n8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the\nLORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.\n\n8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by\nthe hand of Moses.\n\n9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and\nhis sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take\nthee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,\nwithout blemish, and offer them before the LORD.\n\n9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye\na kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of\nthe first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also a\nbullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;\nand a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear\nunto you.\n\n9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle\nof the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood\nbefore the LORD.\n\n9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye\nshould do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.\n\n9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin\noffering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,\nand for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an\natonement for them; as the LORD commanded.\n\n9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin\noffering, which was for himself.\n\n9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped\nhis finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and\npoured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, and\nthe kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he\nburnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.\n\n9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.\n\n9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces\nthereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.\n\n9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the\nburnt offering on the altar.\n\n9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which\nwas the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for\nsin, as the first.\n\n9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to\nthe manner.\n\n9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,\nand burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the\nmorning.\n\n9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace\nofferings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 And\nthe fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which\ncovereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:\n9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon\nthe altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for\na wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.\n\n9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,\nand came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt\noffering, and peace offerings.\n\n9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,\nand came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD\nappeared unto all the people.\n\n9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon\nthe altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people\nsaw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.\n\n10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his\ncenser, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered\nstrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.\n\n10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and\nthey died before the LORD.\n\n10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,\nsaying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all\nthe people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.\n\n10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the\nuncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren\nfrom before the sanctuary out of the camp.\n\n10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the\ncamp; as Moses had said.\n\n10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his\nsons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,\nand lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the\nwhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.\n\n10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon\nyou. And they did according to the word of Moses.\n\n10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor\nstrong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the\ntabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for\never throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put difference\nbetween holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And that\nye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD\nhath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.\n\n10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,\nhis sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the\nofferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside\nthe altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy\nplace, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of\nthe LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.\n\n10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean\nplace; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be\nthy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of\npeace offerings of the children of Israel.\n\n10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the\nofferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a\nstatute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.\n\n10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,\nbehold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the\nsons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have ye\nnot eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,\nand God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to\nmake atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood of\nit was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have\neaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.\n\n10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered\ntheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such\nthings have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,\nshould it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And when\nMoses heard that, he was content.\n\n11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,\n11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts\nwhich ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.\n\n11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the\ncud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.\n\n11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or\nof them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the\ncud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\n\n11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,\nyet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n\n11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not\ntouch; they are unclean to you.\n\n11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath\nfins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them\nshall ye eat.\n\n11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the\nrivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which\nis in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 They\nshall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their\nflesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be\nan abomination unto you.\n\n11:13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the\nfowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle,\nand the ossifrage, and the ospray, 11:14 And the vulture, and the kite\nafter his kind; 11:15 Every raven after his kind; 11:16 And the owl,\nand the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 11:17\nAnd the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 11:18 And\nthe swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 11:19 And the stork,\nthe heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\n\n11:20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an\nabomination unto you.\n\n11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth\nupon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon\nthe earth; 11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his\nkind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his\nkind, and the grasshopper after his kind.\n\n11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,\nshall be an abomination unto you.\n\n11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the\ncarcase of them shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash\nhis clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not\nclovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one\nthat toucheth them shall be unclean.\n\n11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts\nthat go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their\ncarcase shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,\nand be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.\n\n11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things\nthat creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise\nafter his kind, 11:30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the\nlizard, and the snail, and the mole.\n\n11:31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth\ntouch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,\nit shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or\nskin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it\nmust be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it\nshall be cleansed.\n\n11:33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,\nwhatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.\n\n11:34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh\nshall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel\nshall be unclean.\n\n11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth\nshall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall\nbe broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.\n\n11:36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of\nwater, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be\nunclean.\n\n11:37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which\nis to be sown, it shall be clean.\n\n11:38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their\ncarcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.\n\n11:39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the\ncarcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.\n\n11:40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,\nand be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it\nshall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n11:41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be\nan abomination; it shall not be eaten.\n\n11:42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all\nfour, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that\ncreep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an\nabomination.\n\n11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing\nthat creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,\nthat ye should be defiled thereby.\n\n11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify\nyourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye\ndefile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon\nthe earth.\n\n11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,\nto be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.\n\n11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every\nliving creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that\ncreepeth upon the earth: 11:47 To make a difference between the\nunclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the\nbeast that may not be eaten.\n\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a\nman child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days\nof the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.\n\n12:3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be\ncircumcised.\n\n12:4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three\nand thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the\nsanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.\n\n12:5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two\nweeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of\nher purifying threescore and six days.\n\n12:6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or\nfor a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt\noffering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,\nunto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:\n12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for\nher; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is\nthe law for her that hath born a male or a female.\n\n12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two\nturtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the\nother for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for\nher, and she shall be clean.\n\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a man\nshall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,\nand it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he\nshall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the\npriests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of\nthe flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the\nplague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague\nof leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him\nunclean.\n\n13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in\nsight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned\nwhite; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven\ndays: 13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,\nbehold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread\nnot in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:\n13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,\nbehold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in\nthe skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and\nhe shall wash his clothes, and be clean.\n\n13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he\nhath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of\nthe priest again.\n\n13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the\nskin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.\n\n13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought\nunto the priest; 13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if\nthe rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,\nand there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 It is an old leprosy\nin the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,\nand shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.\n\n13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy\ncover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to\nhis foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 Then the priest shall\nconsider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he\nshall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned\nwhite: he is clean.\n\n13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.\n\n13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be\nunclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.\n\n13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he\nshall come unto the priest; 13:17 And the priest shall see him: and,\nbehold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall\npronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.\n\n13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,\nand is healed, 13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a white\nrising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be\nshewed to the priest;

13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it:\nand, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be\nin sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the\nburning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the\nplague of leprosy.\n\n13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white\nhair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but\nbe somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27\nAnd the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be\nspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him\nunclean: it is the plague of leprosy.\n\n13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the\nskin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the\npriest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the\nburning.\n\n13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;\n13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in\nsight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair;\nthen the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a\nleprosy upon the head or beard.\n\n13:31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,\nit be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black\nhair in it;

13:44 He\nis a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him\nutterly unclean; his plague is in his head.\n\n13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,\nand his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and\nshall cry, Unclean, unclean.\n\n13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be\ndefiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall\nhis habitation be.\n\n13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be\na woollen garment, or a linen garment; 13:48 Whether it be in the\nwarp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any\nthing made of skin; 13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in\nthe garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in\nany thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto\nthe priest: 13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut\nup it that hath the plague seven days: 13:51 And he shall look on the\nplague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment,\neither in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that\nis made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.\n\n13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in\nwoollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for\nit is a fretting leprosy;

and the\npriest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in\nthe leper; 14:4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is\nto be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet,\nand hyssop: 14:5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be\nkilled in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:6 As for the living\nbird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the\nhyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the\nbird that was killed over the running water: 14:7 And he shall\nsprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,\nand shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose\ninto the open field.\n\n14:8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave\noff all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and\nafter that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of\nhis tent seven days.\n\n14:9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his\nhair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he\nshall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his\nflesh in water, and he shall be clean.\n\n14:10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without\nblemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three\ntenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and\none log of oil.\n\n14:11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that\nis to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation: 14:12 And the priest shall take\none he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of\noil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 14:13 And he\nshall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering\nand the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is\nthe priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 14:14 And\nthe priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and\nthe priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is\nto be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the\ngreat toe of his right foot: 14:15 And the priest shall take some of\nthe log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 14:16\nAnd the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his\nleft hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times\nbefore the LORD: 14:17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand\nshall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\ntoe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 14:18\nAnd the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour\nupon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make\nan atonement for him before the LORD.\n\n14:19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an\natonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and\nafterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 14:20 And the priest shall\noffer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the\npriest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.\n\n14:21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take\none lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for\nhim, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat\noffering, and a log of oil; 14:22 And two turtledoves, or two young\npigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin\noffering, and the other a burnt offering.\n\n14:23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto\nthe priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,\nbefore the LORD.\n\n14:24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and\nthe log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering\nbefore the LORD: 14:25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass\noffering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass\noffering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\ntoe of his right foot: 14:26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into\nthe palm of his own left hand: 14:27 And the priest shall sprinkle\nwith his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven\ntimes before the LORD: 14:28 And the priest shall put of the oil that\nis in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be\ncleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe\nof his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass\noffering: 14:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand\nhe shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an\natonement for him before the LORD.\n\n14:30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young\npigeons, such as he can get;
